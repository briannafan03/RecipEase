38094,38,2/17/2003,4,Great with a salad. Cooked on top of stove for 15 minutes.Added a shake of cayenne and a pinch of salt.  Used low fat sour cream.  Thanks.
1293707,38,12/21/2011,5,"So simple, so delicious! Great for chilly fall evening. Should have doubled it ;)<br/><br/>Second time around, forgot the remaining cumin. We usually love cumin, but didn't notice the missing 1/2 teaspoon!"
8937,38,12/1/2002,4,This worked very well and is EASY.  I used not quite a whole package (10oz) of white chips.  Great!
126440,38,2/27/2010,5,I made the Mexican topping and took it to bunko.  Everyone loved it.
57222,39,10/1/2011,5,"Made the cheddar bacon topping, adding a sprinkling of black pepper. Yum!"
52282,40,5/21/2005,4,very very sweet. after i waited the 2 days i bought 2 more pints of raspberries and added them to the mix. i'm going to add some as a cake filling today and will take a photo.
124416,40,8/6/2011,0,"Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears."
2000192946,40,5/10/2015,2,"This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!"
76535,40,9/2/2005,4,Very good!
273745,40,12/22/2005,5,Better than the real!!
353911,40,9/26/2006,5,"Absolutely AWESOME! I was speechless when I tried them. I've never had such juicy melt-in-your-mouth chicken made AT HOME!

I would, however, suggest to reduce the amount of flour. 2 cups was overkill for me. "
190375,40,3/9/2007,5,These taste absolutely wonderful!!  My son-in-law loves them and requests them often! I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.
468945,40,2/20/2008,0,"Made my own buttermilk w/ vinegar and milk.  Used defrosted fresh skinless/boneless chicken fillets.  3 lbs.
This mix is extremely flavorful and its light .  I didnt do the bbq thing, but while I cooked homemade to go w/ this I put the chicken in the oven to keep warm and served bbq dipping sauce.  10 stars from my kids !"
255338,40,4/11/2008,5,"First time using liquid smoke in a recipe. Made this as directed. My kids enjoyed this, so we will make this again. Thank you for posting."
1171894,41,4/21/2009,5,"MMMMM! This is so good! I actually soaked the chicken in chicken bouillon first, and it made it super flavorful. I use Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (DH's favorite), and cut chicken into nuggets instead of strips. This makes a good amount, so you could really freeze some and reheat in oven later. Those were our plans, but it was so good that it didn't make it to the ziploc bag!"
136726,41,11/25/2006,5,"I used this mix to make meat balls.Very simple to put together.  I made a batch to put in the freezer too. I find meatballs are really handy to have around just add sauce and cheese for pasta meal or appetizer or for subs or snack.  These turned out to be very good I did add some garlic, but other than that I followed the recipe. The cinnamon in this added something to this that sets it apart from most meatball recipes I tried. Thanks for posting."
68960,43,12/19/2006,4,"We really enjoyed this and so did both my young daughters. For this recipe I decided my crockpot would be perfect. I basically followed the recipe exactally except instead of adding the flour to the onions, I made a mix of flour, salt and pepper in a bag and then tossed the lamb to coat before browning. I added the spices to the onion/garlic to toast them slightly before deglazing with stock. Because I used the crockpot I cut the stock back to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup and used all the canned tomatoes. I added the canned chickpeas about an hour before serving.  This ended up cooking in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours. Served with Recipe #96875 this is a fabulous, filling family meal. Thank you for posting."
618928,45,10/17/2007,4,this is an excellent got 'lamb and a tin of chickpeas what should I cook' recipe. I used our slow cooker too. I made it for 4-5 people ( so 680grms lamb).I followed the recipe but used a can of tomatoes and alittle stock ( maybe 1/4 cup) and transfered the simmered tomatoes to the lamb waiting in the slow cooker. On low for about 5-6 hrs perfect!
217118,45,4/18/2008,5,"This was a lovely Morrocan style dish. I halved the recipe and made it on the stove top like a stew. I added a bit more stock to keep it from drying out. I left off the parsley and/or cilantro, didn't have any. Served with some warm pita type flat breads. I have a VERY picky Husband that even enjoyed this dish."
2000049093,45,3/8/2015,5,"I love lamb stew and usually make an Irish version with potatoes, celery, carrots, onions or something close.  Now and then I&#039;m looking for a change of pace.  Using this recipe as a basis this turned out a really tasty and healthy lamb stew.   I plan to alternate this with the Irish style.  Mmm.  

I used the canned tomatoes, chickpeas, onion, garlic, also a little celery, a jalapeno pepper, and diced-up carrot and malanga root.  Used cumin, cinnamon, ginger, rosemary,  and cloves as well as salt and pepper.  Nice peppy flavor.

Looks great as well, if I get the camera working hope to send a picture."
202555,48,6/20/2007,5,"My husband has just found out that he had to cut down on fat. He..like a lot of Okies is a solid meat and potato guy. 
It has been really hard to find things that he likes to eat but this recipe fit the bill. Has a wonderful flavor and we didn't miss the beef at all with this.
I would highly recommend!!!"
353579,48,8/14/2007,5,"Very good, made with ingredients I usually have.  I didn't want to heat up my kitchen, so I did the final cooking in the microwave, which worked just fine.  Thanks for posting!"
635209,49,11/6/2007,4,"Thought this was a great Core recipe.  My 79-year-old mom loved it too.  I did multiply the proportions x 3 or 4 so I could use whole cans of beans/Ro-tel tomatoes.  Also just added whole egg to the topping due to time and it was very good, but probably not as light as with egg white. I also was out of chicken broth and just used water and upped the seasonings; and used part shredded chicken and part canned chicken breast.  I made it spicy and served it with fat-free sour cream on top.  A winner!!"
681408,49,3/14/2008,0,This is a very good recipe.  We also want to cut back on the fat content in our diet . Very tasty dish!!!
684460,49,1/18/2009,5,We really liked this recipe - something different with chicken is always good to find.  The topping is really good - the kids thought it looked like a twinkie.  They really liked it; even if it wasn't a giant twinkie.
900992,49,2/19/2009,3,"The ""cornbread"" on top is bland. I'd us a real cornbread recipe and put it on top instead."
135017,49,9/29/2007,5,"I am extremely picky about my crockpot recipes (don't like most). This one was great! I made a half-recipe with 1 lb. of pork chops. Because my crockpot tends to burn meat (it's old, with the element on the bottom), I put the fruit mixture in first, then put the chops on top. I then spooned some of the fruit mixture on top of the meat. While at work I remembered I forgot to halve the wine (hee hee) but they still turned out just fine. Thanks, lazyme!
P.S.  I forgot to note that I did not do the cornstarch part and it was fine -- it made a juicy gravy that was nice with the mashed potatoes I also made.  Also, I did not have fresh cranberries and used a scant 1/2 cup of craisins instead, and that was fine, too.  It's all good, lazyme!"
224088,49,10/21/2007,4,"Pork + fruit + crockpot = awesome.

A very good recipe!  Like the other reviewer, we used only about a pound of pork chops, had to sub dried cranberries and didn't bother with the cornstarch.  I didn't really chop things up, just quartered and cored the apples and threw the dried apricots in wholeâ€”everything cooked down to bits. I also skipped the wine.  The apricots and cranberries provided a very intense, rich taste that went great with the pork.  Thanks for the recipe!"
582223,49,12/9/2007,5,really good my 18 month old loved it and she's really picky. I wasn't sure what type of wine to use so I used red. Thanks for the recipe!
1413963,49,10/15/2009,5,One word says it all . Delicious!!!
483827,49,7/15/2008,5,Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.      Thanks for posting .
56680,49,11/11/2006,5,"Oh, This was wonderful!  Had a soup and salad dinner and most people barely ate salad, LOL.  This doubled easily and reheats well too!"
5060,49,5/7/2010,5,"wow red and white sweetness!  DH loved them , I found them a bit two sweet for me but a nice change to serve strawberries.  very easy recipe, but I think 8 ounces of strawvberries is not enough, if I make them again I will double the strawberries and use about half of the cool whip. (I use light cool whip.)  Thanks for posting."
935485,49,6/22/2009,5,Being a healthy bar this is very good.  I make just a couple of changes.  I used stevia instead of splenda.  I used recipe #81194 for the egg substitue.  And I used pure vanilla extract instead of the coffee mate.  I will be making a lot of these!
539686,49,3/28/2011,5,My very health conscious daughter and I tripled this recipe and love them as cookie-sized treats. Very filling and healthy too. Thanks for posting.
6258,49,7/9/2002,5,"Jan, what an interesting combination of flavors.
Really unique and very tasty.  I am so proud of myself because I am growing an herb garden and I had the chives and oregano (fresh).  You didn't specify whether the sundried tomatoes were oil packed or dry, so I chose the dry ones since you had olive oil listed.  I didn't have the pine nuts, so I used sunflower seeds, and that worked out well.  I loved eating this salad...no real cooking on a hot evening.  I will make this one again.  I am wondering how fresh tarragon would be instead of the oregano?  Maybe I will be brave and make it that way soon.  If I do, I will let you know how the substitution fit in.  Thanks for posting this one!"
102602,49,10/26/2003,5,"Jan, we love your pasta salad, it's delicious. I've never used chives in a pasta salad before, it adds a very nice flavor. I made a few changes, I omitted the bacon and served the pine nuts on the side (DS HATES pine nuts). I added some extra garlic, a grating of parmesan cheese and some fresh basil (couldn't resist, it's grows right next to the oregano and chives in my garden). I'll be making this again... soon. Thanks for posting this recipe! "
172467,49,8/24/2009,5,"Lucious cake, firm on the outside, warm and creamy inside. Looks like you slaved away all day but the directions are easy. I will definitely make this again. it's a keeper! Thanks for posting."
2042100,49,10/23/2011,5,"Amazing recipe! The cakes taste even better than the ones you get in most restaurants. Everyone loves it! Easy and on the spot.<br/><br/>Usually I divide it by 3, since there's only my fiancee and me in my house and the regular amount can last for a week."
2002068522,49,3/26/2018,0,i made it and it was amazing
58332,49,2/25/2003,4,"The flavor of the vinegar was a little too ""whang!"" for me so I added a little olive oil.  This tempered the acidity and made a really good lunch. Thank you!"
160497,49,4/22/2007,5,"I have made this several times now.  I substitute regular white vinegar for the white wine vinegar and the whole family enjoys this!  The dressing does not overwhelm the flavors of the vegetables. I also have doubled the recipe, using one can black beans and one can red beans with two cans white beans for a different color combination."
67026,50,5/8/2004,4,Good basic recipe that i used as the basis of some great red sauce.  Thanks!
183565,50,2/13/2006,5,"Wow!  My family loves this recipe and it is a great winter meal.  I do have to say that I adjusted a little but the base remains the same.  Here's what I did different:  I peeled my potatoes and diced them very small. I left out the creamed corn, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and parsley.  Instead I used approx. 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Then right before I stirred in the crab meat, I used my potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes.  This makes the chowder a little thicker.  These are all just my personal preferences.  I have made this several times and have forgotten to review it.  It's awesome!  Thanks Pantry Chef Starkey."
101823,52,3/21/2006,5,"Excellent chowder.  This was the perfect warm-up at the end of a cold, snowy day.  I used more crab meat than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the directions.  This was so simple, and worked well to put in the crockpot to keep warm while I waited for Hubby to come home for the evening.  We will make this again."
349752,53,4/7/2007,5,"Tasty, low fat, fast & easy!  I added 1tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning and 1 tsp. of Cajun Seasoning with a 14 oz. can of crab.  We all like the extra spice.  This recipe would satisfy DH & DS without any side dishes, but I offered saltines & a salad on the side just in case.  Definitely a keeper!"
446143,55,2/1/2008,4,"Oh, how wonderful!  I doubled the crab, and added some carrots (and some extra broth to compensate.)  We still thought there should be more crab though.  The nutmeg flavor was wonderful and the cayenne added a tiny kick.  Lovely recipe PCS!"
226989,55,3/7/2008,4,"DH and I enjoyed this. However I used it only as a base for a potato/seafood chowder. I made as is, except that I added about 1/4lb bacon, which I diced and fryed, tossed with 8oz crab the recipe called for and added about 1 cup pre cooked shirmp. Fryed them all together for a moment and put that all into the chowder. I also used a small can of creamed corn, as I'm not a huge fan of it. I think it needs salt for sure, I also increase the nutmeg and cayenne and added a bit of a chilli/garlic sauce. Good soup, I'll use it again."
868654,55,10/7/2008,5,"Along with the onions we added in a square of salt pork, and fried them up till they were crisp.  We loved this soup, and we will definately have it again when we get the craving for something to warm the tummy!  Thank you!"
1143059,55,2/12/2009,4,"I made this last nite and it was pretty good.  I will make it again, but am thinking it needs something else.  For one thing, there was no salt in the recepie and I did add that...I think next time Im going to add some shrimp and maybe more spices as I thought it was somewhat bland."
302867,58,1/5/2010,5,Delish!  Part of my New Years resolution....  rate recipes I've tried.  Substituted Old Bay for cayenne.  Will make again.  Thanks for a keeper!
1316788,58,2/12/2010,5,Fantastic! I used a little bit of cream since I like a thicker chowder. This was perfect though! A seafood party favorite!
1447190,58,3/18/2010,5,"really good,I did make adjustments to my needs I used soymilk,and left out cayenne,I added 1 box container of chicken broth which I think was 32 oz? I also chopped the potatoes and onions to a mush in a food chopper so it was easier on my digestion and I served over jasmine rice."
1003295,58,3/26/2010,5,"I might be slightly biased because I love crab in any and everything, but this was fantastic. I use cream instead of regular milk for a creamier chowder."
930021,58,6/25/2010,5,"My favorite chowder ever. I may try it with other sea food in future. I wasn't sure about the amounts of garlic and nutmeg, but they blend in really well. I added a couple of dashes of cream."
241697,58,7/10/2010,5,Really great recipe!! Although I did not have creamed corn..i added extra broth. It thickened up really nice!! Thank-You
980899,58,10/18/2010,0,"I used half cream and half 1% milk, added another 1/2c cream at the end. Was without nutmeg. Added nearly a whole pkg of bacon and two 6 oz cans of crab. I will come back to rate this after I make it again using all the posted ingredients. Really yummy, I need to add the nutmeg and see what that does to the flavor."
158966,59,10/20/2010,5,10/18/10 Update. I have to rave again about this recipe. I took the extra time to fry up some bacon and carmelize the onions in the renderings and still added the Old Bay and used the Cajun Seasoning in liu of the cayenne pepper. There were 5 people at the table but I expanded the recipe to feed 9.  I'm glad I did since nearly everyone had seconds. Even my super picky kid likes this!! ****************** 12/22/08: Absolutely fabulous!  This is  so easy to make and oh so satisfying.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay and used Cajun seasoning blend in place of the cayenne.  My nine year old son loved it.  Next time I will try adding some bacon like some of the other reviewers have done.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thanks ever so much for sharing.
827374,59,11/29/2010,3,"We made this last night and really enjoyed it.  I just used canned crab meat and honestly, it didn't really seem to add much flavor to the soup. But really, this can easily just be a chunky potato soup and would be nice and tasty.  I added about 1/2 a cup of thinly sliced carrots and 1/2 a cup of peas which added some nice color, texture and flavor to things.  In addition to the listed seasonings, I used 5 Pepper Seasoning and a few dashes of Italian Seasoning to add some flavor.   Also used 12 oz. of crab and 4 c. of potatoes and added about 1/2 of a cup both broth and milk to compensate for the added volume.  Came out with a nice thickness and is a stick-to-your-ribs kinda meal."
1719774,59,12/16/2010,5,"This was pretty good.  I could tell that my husband loved it.  Mine was spicy.  I think I added more cayenne and ground pepper than was necessary.  Also, I used pepper from a grinder instead of already ground.  I also used frozen corn instead of creamed, added more flour/cornstarch, and didn't have the nutmeg, so I didn't use it.  Thanks for the recipe."
49304,59,2/13/2007,5,Delicious easy to make soup which we really enjoyed. Cut the recipe in half & made it just like the recipe stated. This worked really good for our low fat/ low carb diet. I will defintely be making this soup often. Thank you for posting the recipe.
152118,62,1/2/2011,5,I enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was using frozen corn instead of creamed and vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.  I also added about 1/4 cup chopped shrimp since I had some in the fridge and a splash of half and half at the end.  A bit of salt as well. Yummy.
1781977,62,1/15/2011,4,"Very good base with many options.  First time I added lump crab.  Today went straight vegetarian and sauteed tiny diced zucchini, carrots, sweet red pepper along with the listed veggies (onion, garlic, potato); very colorful and nutritious.  Both times I also added additional sweet frozen corn for a little crunch and sweetness.  Loved the nutmeg. Both times I made this chowder I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and also added 1-2 TBSP of  sherry at the very end.  Very nice combination of flavors and textures.  As stated a above, a good base with limitless combinations of broths/stocks, dairy/soy, seafoods, shredded chicken, etc."
1874846,62,4/4/2011,0,"FABULOUS!<br/><br/>I could not afford any of the ingredients, so I just used what I had in my kitchen and that is the creamed corn. I warmed it up on medium heat for a few minutes and pretended that I was eating the Potato-Crab Chowder. UNBELIEVABLE! Thanks for this recipe."
1631574,62,12/3/2012,5,This is an excellent recipe for crab chowder. I followed the recipe with only a few changes. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper along with the black pepper. I also added about 1/4 cup of sherry at the end of cooking time. We loved it!
1802624639,62,3/30/2014,5,"I like the nutmeg better than I expected. I did make a few changes. Added cayenne and used fresh crab meat (that I caught the day before). I also couldn&#039;t see making this without celery, so I added celery. One tip, cook this chowder a day in advance and let it set in the fridge overnight. Like most soups, stews and chowders, it&#039;s much better on day two."
1802697284,62,11/16/2014,0,Awesome chowder! I used both canned and imitation crab. The second added a lot of flavor. I added Old Bay Seasoning as well. Truly yummy!
2002097693,62,4/5/2018,0,Do you have cook the potatoes beforehand?
337963,62,9/19/2006,4,"The pepper and allspice, along using bacon grease to grease the pan, made this a very flavorful cornbread.  We enjoyed it!"
226081,62,6/29/2005,5,"this is my recipe from my website, www.finedinings.com"
185285,62,8/11/2005,5,"This recipe contained ingredients I knew I liked, in a combonation I wasn't sure of. *Trust me*, if you typically enjoy the bleu cheese, basil & crab - THIS is a your appetizer.  DH, who is very finicky about 'weird' combos adored this dish.  Hint: If you love basil, resist being generous as it competes with the bleu cheese - and that is the base flavor.  I spinkled bleu cheese ontop before baking as well.  This is a great appetizer - thanks for sharing!!"
180087,62,1/31/2006,5,"Great recipe.  We did use canned  crab, it was excellent.  Made the stuffing a day ahead.  We used med to small white mushroom, and found there was more stuffing than needed.  Crab around here is kind of $$$, so we will probably just make the bread crumb, bacon, & cheese stuffing next time, as we were just as satisfied with them.  Thanks for the recipe, the directions were very clear and it made for nice company appetizers."
240552,62,3/3/2008,5,"What a wonderful delicious lunch! I made the filling and put it in a portabella.  I used my own bread crumbs, light cheese, Franks Red Hot sauce as I didn't have tobasco so used more, and imitation crab meat as that is what I had on hand.  I ate the whole thing and am quite full!! LOL!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
446143,62,6/24/2008,5,"DH liked these a lot  Also used the filling in a large portabella cap.  I used an Italian cheese blend and added some mayo to the mixture, and melted some cheese on top too.  Skipped the egg and the wine, and used canned lump crabmeat.  Thanks!"
805572,62,6/12/2010,5,"The best stuffed mushrooms ever..fresh crab is a must, yummy!!  I will definitely make again, thanks for the great recipe =-)"
1802811100,62,6/9/2014,5,"These were a big hit at a recent party, and they went like hotcakes!  I didn&#039;t have fresh crab, but the canned crab worked.  They were still good, but I&#039;ll bet they&#039;ll be delicious with the fresh crab.  Either way, a big hit!"
263525,62,11/17/2005,5,This was really great! It turned out to be really savory.  I made a few adjustments to the amout but it was delicious. Thanks!
58439,62,6/9/2007,4,"GREAT hearty chicken soup, TRUE!
Does make you feel better too!
Comfort food as comfort can be!
Thanks for sharing this warming recipe!"
628951,62,11/13/2007,5,Very good and tasty especially when your craving soup on a low carb diet.
2854176,62,6/7/2013,5,"The best chicken and vegetable I have made! It&#039;s easy, very yummy and low in calories. Thank you!"
101732,62,11/5/2008,5,You're right...it's good!! The kids loved it! (So did I) I used lean ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Thanks so much for postng! Made for My 3 Chef's '08.
52476,62,8/15/2006,5,"We have been eating this bbq sauce for years!  Fortunately for me I live in Northern Alabama and have access to the restaurant that originated the white bbq sauce (Big Bob Gibson's). It's my understanding that this white sauce is indicative only to Northern Alabama. The only way I have ever seen it eaten or have eaten it myself is with ""smoked"" chicken (either poured over the chicken after its done or used as a dipping sauce).  The combination of the smoked chicken and the tartness of the sauce is heavenly! I make this often in the Summer months and encourage everyone to give it a try!!  "
37722,62,3/12/2007,5,"This is excellent and the same recipe I've always used except that we increased the amt. of pepper slightly, and added a little sugar and salt to boot. Never tried the red pepper but will. I lived for 34 years in Huntsville, AL before moving to St. Louis, and our favorite place to have white BBQ sauce was the old Greenbrier restaurant on Hwy 20. There we douse grilled chicken with the sauce, but a major treat is their heavenly hushpuppies, to which we also add the white sauce. I grill skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts pre-seasoned only with seasoned salt and serve the white sauce on the side when serving. And Sally's right: the sauce tastes a whole lot better after chilling for a few days. Finally, don't buy commercially bottled white BBQ sauce; it's usually awful. Thanks, Sally!"
135470,63,5/5/2008,1,I did not care for this at all. All I could taste was the vinegar.
296027,63,5/19/2007,4,"Very nice,fresh summertime martini.  I will make this again tonight and update my response,leaving out the triple sec and Chambord as an alternative method for myself. I think I really like the taste of watermelon, so I felt the other two might have detracted from the flavor I was anticipating.  Triplesec and Chambord aren't my favorite flavors,so that part may just be me - others should make it as written and determine for themselves how they like it.  I LOVED the icy almost slushines I got from shaking the frozen watermelon too (DH helpd to be sure I was vigorous enough!!)....SOOO fabulous and PINK!!! ;)  Will be making again,in 2 weeks when my friend comes in town! Great recipe addition,Lazyme - thank you!!!"
82616,63,11/16/2006,5,"Ok, I made this last night durng one of my baking spree moments. part of it is froze and the other is GONE!!! This is a wonderful cake, great taste. I made no changes. Thanks lorrie :)"
92816,63,12/3/2006,5,This definately deserves 5 stars.I have made various Cherry Cakes and loaves over the years but this one is the best.I love the top on this.I didn't use any icing sugar but just the nice crispy top is so tasty.I also used baking cherries not maraschino.I'll be making this one every Christmas.Thanks for posting it.
593513,66,11/19/2010,5,I did write a review for this cake but it seems to of disappeared along with my private notes. I just noticed it because I was going to make it again this weekend. Must of went into that land far far away !!!!!   I found these very moist and delicious cakes. I had made 3 mini bundt cakes and 3 mini loaf pans. They turned out so good. At the time I didn't have the almond extract so I had used vanilla paste. This is definitely a recipe worth more than 5 stars.
1651233,66,11/14/2011,5,Made this cake this morning and it is so good! This recipe will definitely be a part of my Christmas line up. I made it in two loaf pans and they came out beautifully! I think next time I will replace the cherries with gumdrops and see how that goes. Thanks Lorrie!
9580,66,2/5/2007,5,"I saw this on 30 Minute Meals too!
This sandwich is amazing!  It is so good.  I omitted adding olive oil to the meatball mixture and the results were fine."
462571,66,7/5/2007,5,"These were a snap to whip up and were fantastic! I grilled the meatballs on the BBQ, setting them in a grill pan. I served the subs open-faced rather than topping with the other half bun. These made even tastier leftovers!! Thanks for posting!"
376098,66,8/1/2007,5,This was great! My husband said it tasted just like a chicken parm on a bun without me even telling him the name of the recipe!  We will make this again.
222139,66,9/8/2007,5,I chose this recipe from Fall Pick A Chef.  Could not have picked out a better one.  Great lunch dinner meal.  Because I made so much I will be freezing the chicken for later use.  Thanks for posting this recipe for us to try.
674484,66,9/15/2008,5,"Since this is one of my favorites subs, I decided to try making my own instead of going to the sub shop.  I REALLY LOVED this!  I put mine on the rolls, then added the cheese, put in the oven until cheese melted and the roll was toasted and crunchy.  What a great sandwich Jess!"
1251627,66,6/23/2009,5,"This recipie was so great, the kids loved it. I've also made it with chicken breast on a whole wheat roll for a healthy family dinner."
456221,66,2/20/2010,5,"This is a favorite here, too-- have made it several times.  This is also good served over pasta."
229619,66,6/26/2011,5,I was flipping through one of Rachael Ray's cookbooks and this recipe caught my eye so I checked and sure enough it was already posted here. I did use ground turkey instead of chicken since that's what I had on hand.  It was a hit here and I'll definitely be making it again.
280271,66,11/9/2008,4,This is so yummy. Quick to prepare and can simmer on the stove while you fix the rest of your dinner. It has a nice sweet taste that is not overpowering. Just right. We really enjoyed it. I served it with recipe #211485 and a baked potato. Thanks for posting. :)
305531,66,12/17/2008,4,Really good carrots! There were a great side dish to go along with some grilled salmon and rice. Thanks carolinafan. Made for I Recommend Tag.
1320855,66,7/12/2009,5,"I found this recipe by searching for healthy Indian foods. I was a bit skeptical of this recipe but I LOVED it. I was almost like candy, but for dinner and incredibly healthy.
I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable, used 1 1/3 cups canned pumpkin,  chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable, sweet curry powder instead of the regular spicy kind, and the first time I made it I accidentally used ground white pepper (which has a sort of white-wine taste) and it tasted so good I used it the second time. This is a definite new regular meal. Thanks so much for sharing, I absolutely love it, especially the pumpkin-onion combination (which I'd never thought of before). One thing for anyone else trying this: my parents and sister hated it, but they are not pumpkin fans like I am. I personally don't think it tastes SUPER pumpkin-y, but that's just me. Try it out and see how you like it. I was really surprised to find that I was the only one who liked it, because it tastes like heaven to me."
345569,66,10/5/2009,5,"The last time I tried a bulgur / pumpkin combination, I was disappointed -- even though I like both ingredients -- so I was wary of trying this recipe.  But I am so glad I did, because it was wonderful!  I skipped the oil altogether and didn't miss it.  I also used a buttercup squash instead of pumpkin, and crushed bay leaves since that was all I had; and consomme instead of the vegetable broth.  The curry powder lent such a pretty color to the dish but the flavor wasn't at all overpowering.  Thanks for posting!"
278578,66,10/3/2010,5,"This is great, my first time really cooking with pumpkin. I subbed quinoa for bulgur and let it cook dry for a few extra minutes before adding the water (I didn't have stock). I added just a little maple syrup because it just seemed to be asking for it. Would make this again, thanks!"
1660185,66,1/30/2011,5,"Good flavor and my HS and MS kids ate it with no question! Probably better in the Summer sea on to have some great, fresh veggies with this.  Made mashed potatoes and green beans! Will do this easy, good recipe again!"
22174,66,12/28/2008,4,I am changing my initial review because they got better overnight! At first they seemed a bit blah but I just had one and the sweetness and flavor have improved greatly. Other great thing is these were simple and I had everything on hand! Thank you!
437991,66,5/25/2009,5,"What a nice change to the banana bread i used to make with too ripe bananas! The bananas were so sweet i  only used a little sugar and shredded cocnuts. Thank you for sharing, made for ZWT5"
423539,66,6/2/2009,5,"These are lovely cookies not bland at all. 
Of course I had to have one straight out of the oven and they were moist inside and chewy on the outside. The oats, banana and nuts really shine through.
Thank you iewe for a lovely recipe and one I will make often.
Made for the Dining Daredevils team for ZWT5."
1183623,67,10/28/2009,5,"so good!  i used applesauce in place of the butter/shortening and added extra vanilla instead of lemon juice, and 2 cups of oats just to thicken the batter up a little, and they turned out perfect.  i just wanted something different for lunch snacks and these seem to be a hit!"
495793,70,12/21/2009,3,"These were just so-so.  I agree with another reviewer that they got better overnight.  I was looking for a use of ripe bananas (instead of my usual banana bread) and I thought these would be great.  They are missing something.  The texture is okay, but I think they need some cinnamon or a little brown sugar or molasses, they were just a bit bland.  I think these good be very good with some work on the ""seasoning"".  Thanks for posting."
444132,70,2/17/2010,4,"These were wonderful cookies - I'm rating as a 4 instead of a 5, just because I think you need to make sure the batter is a little thicker, or they'll come out a thin and spread more than expected.  I love the flavour, and I did add 1/4 cup of cinnamon chips and the nuts used were walnuts.  I used butter, too, so next time I'll try shortening (or 1/2 and 1/2) and up the oats/flour if needed.  I think once you make these a couple of times and get the consistency down, they'd be the best thing in the cookie jar!  Made for Zaar Stars - thanks, iewe!!!"
669019,81,5/19/2010,4,"They're like banana bread, in cookie form. I added nutmeg - they would also be good with cinnamon and brown sugar."
678366,81,6/19/2010,5,We enjoyed these cookies and it was a great way to use the brown bananas. A little cinnamon is also a good addition. Made for ZWT6 and were decorated by DD.
522099,82,5/21/2010,5,"I really didn't expect to like this rice as much as I did.  It smelled wonderful while it cooked and tasted good by itself.  But what really brought it to 5 stars is the way it supported and elevated the dahl and mushroom dishes I served it with.  A wonderful complement to any Indian dish.  And the leftovers would make a BANGIN' rice pudding...
Made for Looney Spoons ZWT6"
171790,82,5/22/2010,4,What a wonderful aroma while cooking. Dinner guests rated this from 3 stars(diner prefers plain rice) to 5 stars. I've averaged the ratings. Made for ZWT6.
491979,82,5/24/2010,5,Perfect rice. We love Basmati RiceMade for ZWT 6  for Queens of Quisine
724516,84,6/22/2010,5,"Well I got perfect rice also, I served this with recipe#392938#392938 and the two went very well together. I kind of crushed my cardamom a bit to let the flavour out, you could really taste the two spices. A very nice recipe. Thank you for posting. Made for ZWT#6 2010."
480195,84,6/25/2010,5,The rice turned out perfectly and had good flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6.
852554,84,8/23/2012,5,This was great rice and I loved that it was made in my rice cooker!  I subbed about half the water with coconut milk as I had some leftover from another recipe. Made for ZWT 8
422608,84,2/26/2016,5,"I didn&#039;t follow the instructions exactly, but it came out awesome! Oh and my husband has no clue I put pumpkin in it. He can&#039;t wait to eat it again tonight!"
230860,85,1/9/2011,5,"These were very good.  Maybe my sourdough loaf was small, but I got 4 sandwiches out of this using the stated amounts for each ingredient.  I really liked the crust on the outside of the bread and the kick from the red pepper.  I also really enjoyed the flavors of the turkey, muenster, avocado and cilantro together."
1232945,85,10/8/2012,0,"Loved this salsa flavored meatloaf...tang is a nice touch, and so healthy:)"
27378,91,3/8/2002,5,This is also known as noodle kugle. I love it. It is one of my favorites.
35555,91,3/20/2002,1,"I found this pudding, extremely discusting.  It was way to rich for my taste buds, and it's texture was not one to my liking. Yuck!"
89210,91,6/8/2003,4,This is pretty good !! I used frozen spinach :( probably won't do that again ! next time I'm considering sour creme and poppyseeds too
227666,91,11/4/2005,4,"I halved this recipe, and it turned out pretty good, except for maybe a little too much vanilla extract for my taste. I might be making again for one of those warm, summer nights. :]"
53932,91,7/16/2006,5,"I also halved the recipe and not reading it carefully, used vanilla yogurt rather than plain.  I love vanilla so with the addition of even more, I liked this!  Perfect treat for a hot summer day."
442988,91,5/30/2007,3,"I'm sorry I couldn't give this a higher rating ... I appreciated the fact that this could be made so that it's virtually nonfat.  But I thought there was too much gelatin in it -- in fact, when I tried to pour the base mixture into the ice cream freezer, it had already solidified into a gelatinous, mass.  (I used Trader Joe's plain nonfat yogurt).  I'll keep looking for my platonic ideal of vanilla frozen yogurt -- but thanks for posting this!"
490060,92,6/22/2007,5,"i have had no problem with the gelatin, as another user has posted.  I have only had good results, the most fluffy, light, dreamy, creamy frozen yogurt I have ever made. DEFINITELY the best vanilla frozen yogurt I have had."
447165,92,8/28/2007,5,I halved this (except the vanilla- oops!) for my Cuisinart icecream maker as a couple others did-- great stuff!  We are excited to try it tomorrow after it's ripened too because the super-frozen parts left in the bowl were the best we thought.  We didn't find we needed to chill the mixture after adding the yogurt and vanilla because the yogurt came straight from the fridge.  I love that this is low fat and the gelatin insead of eggs which make me nervous to use uncooked.  Thanks Tom!
464253,92,5/6/2008,4,"On the first night, the yogurt was a great consistency, creamy and fluffy. Unfortunately, it got pretty hard and icy after sitting in the freezer overnight. Better than other recipes I've tried in that regard and maybe it just can't be avoided with home made. Definitely try this, it's delicious!"
176615,92,6/10/2008,5,"Excellent! Light, fluffy, and creamy, not icy like homemade lowfat frozen desserts tend to be. I halved the recipe and used the Cusinart ice cream maker. So easy and so healthy, I'll be making this often. Highly suggest Stonyfield Farm or other plain organic yogurt as the flavor and quality is so much better, in my opinion, than regular commercial varieties. Thanks for sharing your recipe! UPDATE: I make this often and especially like using Stonyfield's vanilla yogurt and serving with fresh sliced strawberries or other berries. Also LOVE this with a drizzle of local honey. Yum. To die for!"
1108690,92,1/2/2009,1,"What a disastrous recipe.  We used fat free yogurt instead of low fat yogurt which could have been the problem, but our concoction was anything but frozen yogurt.  It took a long time for it to finally become a consistency other than regular yogurt.  When it finally did harden, it was like eating flakes of sorbet. Very disappointing.  We will never use this recipe again.  However, we still are looking for a good fat free frozen yogurt recipe, if anyone has any suggestions.  But please, don't make the same mistake we did by using this unsuccessful recipe."
960426,93,12/16/2009,4,"Just to comment on 
Chef #1108690 's review.  There's no telling how much more gelatin you added to this recipe that was called for by using non-fat yogurt. 
That's how they make fat-free yogurt stand up without any fat.   That accounts for your flakes.  Delicious animal-bone-collagen flakes."
1320105,93,5/14/2010,2,None of my kids liked this at all.  It still had a bitter taste like yogurt normally does.  Nothing like the frozen yogurt from the stores.
386585,93,9/29/2008,5,"This is a great variation on the classic Reuben sandwich.  Instead of the tartness of sauerkraut, the sweet and tangy cole slaw mixture was a nice change.  It is also really easy to make, and I will definitely be having this again (and without the guilt of a regular Reuben)!  Thanks for posting, 2Bleu.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
2001891832,93,4/30/2018,0,There is no cooking temp?????? Love this recipe so I will assume it is 350?????
1202739,93,9/12/2010,5,"I am AMAZED at the people who DID NOT FOLLOW THE RECIPE, but chose to give it one to three stars.  The recipe calls for LOW FAT yogurt, not non-fat.  Another review makes the point that the reason non-fat yogurt is gelatinous is because of GELATIN!  The recipe was formulated for low-fat yogurt.  I make lots of substitutions in recipes, but I would never PRESUME to rate a recipe for not turning out well when I did not follow the directions.<br/><br/>I thought this recipe turned out very well.  As another reviewer, I halved the recipe because I only had a 32 oz tub of yogurt and was a cup short for the full recipe.  I used low-fat Vanilla yogurt and Splenda instead of sugar.  I also agree with another reviewer that it can go straight in the ice cream maker after incorporating the yogurt and vanilla.<br/><br/>This is very light and refreshing.  My husband and I like intense vanilla flavor, and by using vanilla yogurt and vanilla extract it was quite tasty.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I think next time I may chunk up some fresh pineapple to drop in as well - I think the tartness of the pineapple would go well with the yogurt.  Cheers!"
12657,93,7/30/2003,3,"The instructions in this recipe are very lucid and easy to follow, but the end result was a little drier than I had hoped. The combination of ingredients worked well but it lacked the 'juice' that perhaps a chopped tomato could have provided. I topped this with a good amount of plain yogurt before serving and that did make it less dry. Thanks for posting, Karyl."
74736,93,3/26/2004,5,"Thought this was delicious Karyl, it's nice to know sweet potatos CAN be made without brown sugar or marshmellows! This recipe almost reminded me of some smothered hashbrowns we had that were enjoyed all around, only a lot less greasy:)"
1802694935,93,11/27/2014,5,I found this to be a very good take off on sweet potatos.  The use of olive oil was a good addition to this recipe that really made the difference.  The sweet peppers were also a plus.  For something different.  Go this one!!!
56112,94,4/18/2003,4,"Real good recipe.  Will definately make this again.  I probably will not add quite as much sugar to the next batch.  This one was just a little too sweet for my taste.  For those who like their coffee really sweet, it will be just perfect the way it is.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
29621,94,7/31/2004,5,"Thanks for the great recipe!

I used Splenda instead of Sugar, still Excellent!

"
537179,94,11/21/2008,4,Nice recipe! I scaled this down for 2. Was nice and easy. Great taste.
583401,94,9/5/2011,5,"This was delicious. I used butter instead of margarine which probably added a lot more fat then necessary.. but these are for my brother who needs the extra calories. Easy, fast, and tasty."
326970,100,10/27/2006,5,"I made this Jambalaya and we all loved it.  I didn't add all the cayenne pepper at once as DH isn't nuts about hot'n'spicy.  Used regular frozen corn rather than baby corn chopped.  Excellent.  My crock pot was too small so finished on the stove top.  Next time I make it, I'll cut it in half."
320245,100,9/29/2006,5,"Amazing - I always love your recipes, kittencal! I cook for very large groups on a very small budget, so in lieu of the zucchini I just added several cans of corn. Also (I'm in Switzerland), since cheddar cheese is expensive, I subsituted Fontal cheese in the dumplings and added quite a bit more cayenne than it called for. It was a hit! Thanks so much for all of your great cooking ideas!"
44642,108,10/19/2006,0,"Just posting, so I will know I tryed this. Never have found one of his recipes that I like. Did not make the polenta."
162191,108,10/20/2006,5,I loved this recipe.
137302,109,4/18/2012,2,This is probably one of those toppings which has to become an acquired taste.  It seemed to have an off taste to me that may have come from the cornstarch.  Honey is thick on it's own when cooled slightly and I think that if someone wanted their honey and butter mixed they would do better to just mix and heat them without the cornstarch.  Made for PAC Spring 2012
238496,109,10/4/2007,4,Delicious and fresh are the words I would choose for this recipe. I gave four stars because I like very spicy food. This is a personal observation only and not a critiscim of this recipe. I recommend it. My changes were to add a habenero chili as well. I sauted it over a low flame for 5-6 minutes. This kicks up the heat factor. Thank you lilchris for a great recipe.
424680,110,11/2/2009,5,"Made this with raw apple cider & my last bag of frozen cranberries! I used a generous tablespoon of minced orange zest ~ Very nice tasting sauce, although another time I want to try it mixed with a pint or so of homemade chunky applesauce! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Sassy Sauces! theme in the current My 3 Chefs event]"
27443,110,1/15/2008,5,"If you like Reubens this is a must to try!  I can not say enough about this sandwich. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I made it as an open face, thus eliminating the calories etc of 1 slice of bread. Thanks for sharing your revision."
803511,110,6/26/2009,5,"Great Reuben variation!  I liked making the coleslaw/sauerkraut myself.  I added an extra handful of cabbage into the pot because it was cooking down so much it didn't look like enough for two sandwiches.  When I put the sandwiches together I only ended up using about 2/3 of the meat and 1/2 the cheese called for.  I shredded cheese off a block instead of using slices.  Lastly, I just can't give up my usual Reuben sauce (mayo, chili sauce, horseradish) so we subbed that for the mayo/mustard suggested in your recipe.  I think overall using less cheese and meat brought this ""lighter"" Reuben down even farther!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
222564,112,10/25/2012,5,"Great, well balanced, sweet and savory, crispy salad with fruity apple cider vinaigrette. I was tempted to substitute apple juice concentrate to the apple cider to it's reduced quantity, but restrained myself and kept to the recipe."
222478,112,5/1/2010,5,"Very tasty! One thing I couldn't bring myself to do was combine the melted butter with the breadcrumbs because I think it would have made it too hard to coat the scallops evenly, instead I melted the butter along with the garlic and tossed the mix around with the scallops, then dipped in the breadcrumbs. It was much enjoyed over a bed of couscous."
780172,112,7/3/2013,5,This is a super easy dish to prepare. I felt it lacked a little seasoning so added a little Old Bay Seasoning. I got to use parsley from my garden. Nice way to make scallops.
1609258,112,9/13/2011,4,"Good but garlicy.  It didn't really have that umami taste that real boursin has but it is still good as a dip or a spread.  It gets better with age so don't judge based on how it taste straight out of the food processor.  I couldn't find the umeboshi plum paste but I did find some pickled umeboshi pickled plums that I tossed into the food processor with everything else.  If you can't find the plums, I think a good sub would be miso paste."
364211,112,9/7/2011,5,"WOW! What a sandwich. Loved, loved, loved the sauce. I did not expect this to be so good.  I would give this an 8 star rating if I could.  I used thin sliced whole wheat bread that I keep in the freezer because I don't use bread a lot.  Purchased the meat and cheese especially for this sandwich, except I made a mistake and ordered provolone instead of swiss.  I used a dill pickle relish that I already had and put a thin layer on the sandwich.  Next time I will make with the swiss cheese.  gailanng, thanks so much for posting"
4470,112,10/17/2002,4,"At the request of the chef  I reviewed the amounts of the ingredients and came up with the following:
1 can French beans or 3/4 lb fresh, frenched beans
2 14 oz cans Artichoke hearts
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 cup bread crumbs
2 tbsp butter
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 can French's Fried Onions
Salt & pepper to taste
Followed the steps except for the fried onions I did not add them until the final 15 minutes.
  This is a very tasty recipe with a different veggie combination.  Easy to put together and great flavor..  The recipe had more bread crumbs in it than I used.  I think this would  be very tasty but I wanted to cut back on the crumbs and Olive oil. Thanks Kari for a lovely addition to my cookbook.  This is a 5 star recipe but because of the changes I made to it I rated it a 4 star."
22898,112,11/29/2002,4,I followed Bergy's quantities for this recipe so I can't give it a 5 but it is delicious and I will usee it again.  I do agree with Bergy that it is a 5.
873573,113,12/29/2009,5,"I love the idea of mixing artichokes with green bean casserole!  I made this recipe for my Christmas Eve dinner when I found out that twice as many people were coming and I didn't have enough food prepared.  This is quick and easy and tasted great!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I mixed in a little cram of mushroom soup to keep it glued, but I will definitely try again with the bread crumbs.  Nice play on the traditional casserole! =)"
68460,114,5/3/2003,5,"These cakes couldn't be quicker, easier and more delicious if they tried.  I used 1 pound of cleaned and deveined shrimp, then all of the rest of the ingredients exactly.  The sweet chilli sauce has the perfect amount of sweet and hot to it to give these wonderful cakes just the right tang.  My husband and I polished off half the batch as quickly as they came out of the frying pan!  We just LOVE these and I'll be making them again and again.  Thanks so much KitchenManiac...these are terrific!"
182292,114,12/23/2004,5,"Agreed: quick, easy, delicious. An entire platter vanished into a very picky Christmas party crowd, who all looked around for more. And that you can freeze the raw patties for quick cooking later is a huge plus. 

We substituted shrimp for the prawns, lime zest and juice for the leaves, used pre-crushed cornflakes (guessing that 2 c. of flakes crushes down to about 1/4 c. of crumbs). We also tried two sorts of Thai sweet chili sauce...one very sweet and mild, one very spicy. I advise using the spicy one in the prawn cake recipe and then serving with the mild one for dipping."
10033,114,7/8/2007,5,"Excellent recipe, loved by all. I had a hard time finding lime leaves in the amount of time I had to shop (I know where I could find them for sure but couldn't get over there before dinner), so I just left htem out, and the flavor was still very good. Thanks so much for posting."
82616,114,11/20/2006,5,"I made this up for Thanksgiving gifts. What a wonderful treat. Great mixture of sweet and salty, and I love the sympbolism of each item. This truly is a great ""gift"". Thanks"
125388,115,11/25/2006,5,"Wonderful idea for Thanksgiving!  I made these in Wilton plastic disposable decorating bags (to resemble a cornucopia).  I printed the blessing on the computer and stapled it to the top of each bag.  I placed one on the top of each plate on the Thanksgiving table.  We read this blessing as our prayer before dinner.  Everyone young and old alike, loved it!  I made 12 of these, and added each ingredient individually to the bags to make sure each bag got some of each ingredient."
35488,118,11/27/2008,5,"Thanks, NovaLee - I was having a hard Thanksgiving today, and came across this recipe.  Will make and give it with thanks for many Thanksgivings to come!"
262312,118,6/15/2009,5,"these were great!!  love finding new meatball recipes!  made as written but added garlic powder, parmesan cheese and used heavy cream instead of milk.  oh, and i added an egg. made up ahead of time and had chilling in fridge til i was ready for them.  thanks for a great meatball recipe!  will add to my keeper collection!"
4470,119,4/26/2006,4, Lovely flavor - I enjoy Adobo spice. Instead of scallions I used 1/4 sweet onion (just for flavor).  I found it a bit dry so I added 2 tbsp Ketjap Benteng (An Indonisian sauce) I like my peppers  crisp so added them for the last 5 min only . Instead of regular noodles I used Whole Wheat. Delicious dinner thanks Chef Christine
107135,119,4/14/2005,5,this is a nice recipe to have if you make alot of muffins like i do  i love your muffin recipes dee
209441,120,5/12/2005,5,"What a fantastic mix! I made up a recipe of this and stuck it in my freezer to use for recipes like muffins and cakes, brilliant idea KITTENCAL! and really great streusel too!"
52543,120,5/12/2005,5,"I usually have a batch of Healthy Bran Muffin mix (#114718) in my fridge; I now have a batch of your streusel mix in my freezer. These 2 mixes will be perfect mates for a quick, easy, tasty breakfast or snack. As usual, I used pecans instead of yucky walnuts. Thanx Kitten!"
235751,120,8/28/2005,5,"What a great idea and recipe! It would be a real time-saver when making muffins, coffee cakes, sweet potato casseroles, etc.  Thanks so much for posting - you've done it again, Kittencal."
86318,120,3/23/2013,5,"These noodles are wonderful! I did halve the recipe, and used snow pea shoots instead of gai lan. I also used shimeji mushrooms for oyster mushrooms, and dried rice noodles instead of fresh. The recipe doesn&#039;t list chicken stock in the ingredients, although it is in the directions. I used 1 3/4 cup stock for my half batch (though more might be better). It took longer than I expected for the dried noodles to cook, so I ended up cooking them separately, and putting the sauce over them in the bowl. Also, I don&#039;t know so much about cooking with black beans. I soaked mine in hot water, and then chopped them before adding them to the pan. It didn&#039;t seem to hurt. Thank you very very much for this delicious recipe."
397462,120,9/25/2008,5,"I made this a few days ago, it is one of the quickest dessert recipes I' ve found. My son who is my food critic loves this and has asked me to make another one. I made no changes but next time I won't bake it quite as long."
328099,122,10/5/2008,5,"Have had several gooey butter cakes while visiting our kids in St. Louis.  When I found this recipe, I was really excited--made it this past weekend when the St. Louis family was home--what a fabulous treat.  This will be made for many occasions in the future.  Thank you,"
403193,122,10/27/2008,5,WOW OMGosh !  nmlawrence Thank you We love this cake.  I have made this cake for years but in our resent move I misplaced it.  So I came to Recipe Zar.  For help to just make sure I didnâ€™t mess up.  These instructions are so well written and I think that the one thing that I never did is the secret trick to Perfect Ooie Gooie Butter Cake and that is melting the butter.  Thank you for posting and making my Gooie Gooieâ€™er  and my Butter Cake better.  Lori
61995,123,10/28/2008,5,"I have been making this for more than 10 years!  Mine is called ""Neiman Marcus butter cake, since it is so rich!  I use a 13 x 9 x 2 inch glass pan and have never had it spill over!  You can easily chance the flavor by changing the type of cake mix and extract!  I remember someone changing hers to Lemon and it went over very well!  I love it at room temp or slightly warm!  And cut it in tiny pieces!  People can take more than one!  I usually leave it in the pan and let people cut it themselves!  This is one of my top favorite recipes!"
440735,123,12/25/2009,5,I am from St. Louis and have grown up on Gooey Butter Cakes! This has got to be one of the best recipes for this.  I think the vanilla is the magic to it. This is a very sweet cake. I only put 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Next time I will only use three.  I did use a 9x13 and placed it on a cookie sheet. It took much longer to cook as I expected but wanted to try it.  I took it out when it was golden brown.  I would agree with letting it completely cool.  Enjoy!
633027,124,12/29/2009,5,"My husband and I lived in (and loved) St. Louis for several years before moving to central Texas.  The food is one of the things we miss most about STL.  My husband decided he wanted to make gooey butter cake for our Christmas dessert, and since he couldn't find the recipe he's used in the past, he chose this one to try.  He followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly!  It's very sweet, melt-in-your-mouth gooey, and certainly addictive.  The directions were very clear and detailed.  Bake time for our oven was 40 minutes; we served it at room temperature.  We look forward to making it again soon.  Thank you SO much for posting this St. Louis treat!!!!"
543968,126,4/21/2010,5,"WOW!!! This is so very very very good!
Very easy to make.  
I actually forgot to put in the vanilla or almond flavoring. 
It didn't matter!
It was scrumptious.
I made it to take to our church Bible Study, as we eat afterwards.
Well, we made the mistake of trying it first, to see what an ""ooey gooey butter cake"" would taste like!
We then considered keeping it for ourselves, and buying something on the way, instead of taking it! LOL.
But I am going to take it.
And I know right now, there won't be any left! It just couldn't be better. Thank you!"
2100189,128,12/12/2011,5,"This is the same recipe that I used in St. Louis about 35 years ago, at age 10. :-) I am from Affton/Kirkwood/Glendale area & now reside in SE Florida. I lost my recipe & am thankful that you posted. Today I made small tartlets with this recipe & put almond filling & cherry pie filling in the bottom, spooned the cheese mix over the top & added sliced almonds. Baking time is about 20 minutes or so, depending on your oven. I also used Mexican vanilla. It is a great vanilla for baking use. The aluminum cupcake cups with the wax paper liners work great for sharing, once the tartlet is removed from the tartlet pans. I topped off with powdered sugar. The ladies @ the Cookie Exchange party I made them for were all a buzz with curiousity & they went like lightning. This is an excellent recipe and is really easy to make."
1701315,128,3/25/2012,5,"I grew up in Southern MO, but we often drove up to STL and would get fed Gooey Butter Cakes by our hosts.  I have tried far more complicated and time consuming recipes for them, and this easiest of versions has to take the cake...pun intended.  Wonderfully sweet and gooey with that most amazing phenomenon one calls a sugar crust.  Thanks for bringing back fond childhood memories!"
1351584,131,7/2/2012,5,"Delicious! But kinda on the sweet side. Instead of 4 cups confectioners sugar, I just put 2. Still tastes great. Just less sweeter. My kids love it"
7248862,131,12/5/2013,5,THIS recipe was the reason I joined this site! I too am from St. Louis and this recipe (as is) takes me back home. Will try other variations...15 STARS...GREAT recipe
2001338551,131,4/4/2017,0,Have made this cake often. Have added 1 1/2 c of mashed sweet potatoes to filling mixture with tsp of cinnamon. Changes flavor totally.
492343,131,12/13/2007,5,Yummy
1802406495,131,1/25/2014,0,"To everyone reading this. There is no such thing as St Louis Gooey Buttercake. Buttercake or Philadelphia Buttercake as we know, was brought here by the Germans bakers, that came over here. ButterKuchen came from Germany. Many of the German people that settled in and around Philadelphia were great bakers, butchers and candy makers amongst other thing. If you want Buttercake, it exists only around Philadelphia in its true and original form. It started where many of the German immigrants came to live &quot;PHILADELPHIA.&quot;"
1338623,133,2/4/2014,5,"Gooey Butter Cake is my husbands favorite and since we moved away from St. Louis, he has been craving it. So being the good wife I am, I searched for a recipe, found this one and made it for him. He LOVED it! Super easy to make and since he loved it, saving the recipe to make again and again :)"
91584,133,3/31/2014,5,Super wonderful recipe! Yum Yum Yum  :)
2000405375,133,8/15/2015,4,"I followed the (easy) recipe exactly, and it came out real yummy, but I was afraid I&#039;d done something wrong, because it really didn&#039;t rise much at all. It only came up about half way in a 2 inch pan. In comparing to other recipes, I found that other than adding a cup of chocolate chips and a half cup of butter to the topping, &quot;Paula Dean&#039;s Ooey Gooey Chocolate Chip Cake&quot;  is identical, and specifies a 9x13x2 pan. It&#039;s really a cookie dough, which shouldn&#039;t rise much. Omit the needless warning, and I&#039;d give it 5 stars."
2000488445,133,9/21/2015,4,Wow! This turned out perfectly!! My husband&#039;s been asking me to make a gooey butter cake for a while now and this was wonderful!! We&#039;re from the St Louis area and I try different bakery versions all the time! 2 thumbs up from this household! :)
2000780659,135,12/27/2015,5,Whoever invented this recipe is a genius. My boyfriend is from Texas and grew up eating this stuff. He talks about it all the time so I made a batch on Christmas. He said it was the best gooey butter cake he&#039;s had. Recipe is super simple and easy to follow.
571722,135,1/9/2017,1,"This was incredibly sweet, and I reduced the sugar content to 3 cups. I agree it is easy, but if there's a next time I would make it in it's original scratch made recipe, the box cake (though it was a healthier, non-gmo, etc) was just as bad."
2001403242,135,2/23/2017,0,"I really love St, Louis Gooey Butter cake, but I can only get it when I get to the city. I would love to be able to get it in my hometown. Where is that you ask? Farmington, Missouri it's about 80 miles south of St. Louis. I don't get to travel there but once every 3 to 4 yrs. To go to the hospital for test."
2001719206,135,9/18/2017,1,This was really terrible. It was overwhelmingly sweet and I used 3 cups of the confectioners instead of 4. And the cake mixture was bizzare. It was grainy and weird. I made it because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand but I wouldn't make again.
803102,136,10/25/2017,0,"this is the same recipe my mom used 45 years ago, now my husband's co-workers ask him to bring it for the staff pot lucks, you can use other cake mixes to chocolate, spice/add pumpkin to filling and pumpkin spice (that one is my favorite )"
2001782909,136,11/7/2017,5,"This was so so delicious! Our family enjoyed it so much and was gone in one day! It taste better then gooey butter cake in St. Louis where I live! It was not overly sweet and wasn't to gooey or to overdone! I would recommend refrigerating it, and you HAVE to let it cool!! For ours we had to cook it for about 20-30 minutes longer but, overall this was The Best Gooey Butter Cake that I have ever had!!"
2001861106,136,12/16/2017,5,"I first learned about gooey cake over 30 years ago while living in Florida. We took a batch with us up to our friends' cabin in the woods. They loved it! When they heard some more of our friends arriving they hid the remaining cake in their chest of drawers so they didn't have to share it! I'll be preparing five cakes this weekend to share with our neighbors. Thirty years is a long time to remember anything, so thank you for the recipe! I'm giving it five stars in advance cause I know it will be awesome!"
2002100759,136,4/8/2018,1,"I am from Missouri and lived here most of my life and never heard of this until about 3 years ago when I found them for sale in the Deep South. I thought they were of Southern origin. It is correct to claim this as a St. Louis dessert, but saying it represents the entire State of Missouri is pushing it."
43222046,136,4/10/2018,5,It’s a pretty close. But the 4 cups of powdered sugar was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I’ll leave it at 2 cups and add a bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling.
2000551249,139,7/11/2018,5,We have substituted a lemon cake mix for the yellow cake mix and it is absolutely amazing. This is a go-to recipe to bring a dish parties and bbq's.
2002265401,139,9/3/2018,2,I will start by saying that I followed the recipe to a T and I’ Sure it came out as expected but baby..... I felt the diabetes coming on after each bite. It tasted great but was just way too sweet. My 9 year old who could eat a bowl of sugar if I allowed it even said it was a “little” too sweet. I honestly would cut the powdered sugar measurement in half. Unfortunately I just dumped the entire lot of what was left after four family members had one serving each. Wow this is sweet.
2001205226,139,11/3/2018,5,"This is an exceptionally tasty cake! Very sweet, yes - just take a smaller serving. I am a chocoholic, and rarely care for sweets that are not chocolate. This cake is an exception - it is utterly delicious! You will not fully realize this unless you try it!"
450004,139,9/23/2008,4,"We really enjoyed this! We served it with Greek salad, and icy cold Retsina, from Corinthia! We were going to give it a 5, but thought maybe the sauce could be a little thicker. I will make double the amount of roux next time.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it! [Made for Fall 08 PAC]"
73746,139,4/12/2010,5,"I have made these several times now and they are fabulous. This time I ran out of muffin cases so I made a dozen muffins and a cake and both came out lovely

Definately a 5* recipe"
461897,141,3/1/2009,5,"The best corn muffins ever! Very soft and sweet. The only thing I added was a touch of honey! I always double the recipe and the muffins fly off the table! Very very good corn muffin, tender and moist!"
242006,142,8/20/2009,5,"Last night I made cornbread using the recipe on the back of the box.  They changed it, because it was not this recipe.  The new recipe on the box sucks!  Don't make it, make this one!  Trust me, this recipe right here, is the ONLY recipe you'll ever need."
122877,142,10/13/2009,4,Insomnia struck so I made these this morning.  Simple and quite tasty.  I did add about 2 tbl of honey for a little extra sweetness.
362590,142,12/2/2009,4,Good recipe. Made them with 1 cup flour and 1 cup cornmeal and added 1/2 cup of raspberries.
250835,142,1/9/2010,5,"This is awesome stuff!  I used this recipe to make cornbread instead of muffins. Soft, moist and sweet.  Just an FYI due to a previous review: There are two cornbread recipes on the Albers box. One is for regular cornbread and one is for sweet cornbread or muffins. I've made both and THIS recipe is the way to go!  :-)"
857489,142,2/3/2010,5,"This is the only recipe I've ever used for cornbread. I used to make the Marie Callendar's mix, but not ever again once I tried this! It is awesome, so moist and sweet, like cake. I hate dry, crumbly, tasteless cornbread. I always use the square pan option, I haven't tried the muffins. I highly recommend using the albers cornmeal and this recipe!"
394077,142,3/21/2011,5,"My goodness these are so good!  I used buttermilk and they are buttery, moist, tender and perfectly sweeten.  I used Alber corn meal as suggested.  Keeper recipe.  Wow."
1879548,142,5/29/2011,5,"I made the flour and corn meal both 1 cup and soaked my corn meal in the milk first.<br/>I also baked them in a whoopie pie or popover pan for my son - he eats them like the Thomas' toaster cakes, they freeze amazingly well."
1056692,142,8/25/2011,5,"This is my favorite corn bread recipe!  I'm so glad to find it here already.  I actually had to dig my cornmeal box out of the recycling after moving years ago and cut this recipe off the side because no stores around me carried Albers and other brands didn't have this sweeter recipe on them.  I always put a touch of oil or shortening in my 10 inch cast iron skillet and heat it smoking hot while I mix this up so that it sizzles and crisps the outside of the bread when I pour it in, then I put it in the oven.  Great recipe for sweet cornbread."
269198,142,9/30/2011,5,These are wonderfully tender and sweet! I will never buy Jiffy Mix again because these are so much better. I served them with beans and we will have the leftovers for breakfast.
2000201349,142,5/13/2015,5,I cut this recipe off the Albers corn meal box years and years ago.  This has been my one and only recipe for almost 40 years.  My sons friends always wanted me to make them when they came out to the farm.  I get more compliments on these then on any other baking.
131126,142,11/6/2012,5,"Spicy, easy, and good!  I served on a TV night with a tray of oven baked chicken fingers, celery sticks, strips of red peppers, baby carrots, bread sticks, and boiled red potato slices.  It made for nice finger food, literally took minutes to assemble, and satisfied my blue cheese & spicy craving. Thank you for sharing the recipe!  Made for Fall 2012 Pick A Chef."
364211,142,10/21/2012,5,This does have a nice fresh taste.  I used cracker crumbs on the eggplant slices.  Thanks for posting Chef Curt.  Made for Fall PAC 2012.
2000431901,142,2/26/2016,4,Nice and easy. I used one big grocery store eggplant. Didn&#039;t soak it overnight and thought it was still tender enough. Added chopped fresh parsley after cooking.
1950221,142,7/6/2011,5,"Good recipe.  Great crumb and taste.  I halved the recipe which made some measurements difficult, but ended up with 1/4 c. coconut oil, 1/4 t. nutmeg and 2 eggs.  I also used almond milk.  DH liked, so will make again.  Might add some brown sugar for richness next time."
1759365,142,7/26/2012,4,"I gave this recipe four stars only because i like my muffins just a bit sweeter.  i think i will try it with a little honey or sugar.  other than that, they are light and airy and most of all i used up some of my fresh zucchini out of my garden.  Yum yum!!  i put half in the frig and half in the freezer and my daughter who doesn't have to be glueten free loves them and the fact they are so low in calories.  she sneaks one out of frig or freezer every time she comes over.  so give it a try, if you like it just a tad sweet, then add a little sweetness of some kind.  i will definitely make this recipe again.  thanks"
229448,142,3/5/2007,4,"This recipe was delightful! Very old world tasting, my husband refused to believe that apples and onion went together but this proved him wrong."
249623,142,6/14/2009,0,Sounds marvelous!!! I wish I could try this. Maybe after a few more pounds!
313120,142,9/2/2006,5,Very Good Soup.  Thanks.
158086,142,5/7/2010,5,This was a very good fast soup...I did not put any ground beef in it and I did not have any tomato juice so I used tomato sauce and watered it down...turned out great...
2060185,142,11/10/2011,0,I used this recipe to clean use up some foods I had in the freezer. It was great and quite simple. It was very hearty and everyone enjoyed it much!
445492,142,5/13/2007,5,Great recipe - amazing flavor.  Easy to make too!
89831,142,5/29/2007,5,"These were buttery rich delicious! I made these in a 13 x 9-inch pan and they baked out well, thank you for sharing Diana!...Kitten:)"
352538,143,12/1/2010,5,"Love, love these.  The rice flour gives such a nice texture.  Thanks for posting."
222564,143,12/23/2012,5,"Good, solid basic recipe. Turns out just like on the picture."
39301,143,9/15/2009,5,This was a huge hit with both of my kids.  Thanks for posting!
726344,143,1/25/2008,4,Have made these many times  very good
320640,143,2/26/2010,5,"Delicious! I was trying to cut back the recipe a little, but ended up just making the whole thing. So my bf and I have been eating it all week. But, hey, we sure don't mind. I didn't know what kind of onion or potato to use, so I just kept it common. I used small red onions and regular Russett, but I think you could get away with a smaller potatoes too. Serving 6 - so this makes a lot. Very tasty, thank you! Chnang na! heeehee"
134011,143,3/19/2011,5,Absolute comfort food!  Really yummy.  It also makes lots of sauce & was wonderful over rice & veg.  I also used 1/2 chilli powder due to younger family and it was nicely warm for our tastes.  Great recipe!  This is the last of 3 made for PAC 2011
280271,144,4/5/2008,5,"I have to give this a 5 star. I don't care for Quinoa. DH love this stuff. I prepared this for him today and took a taste like I always do...and thought ooh this is good. You can taste all the flavors, but the mint is most dominate without being overpowering. If there is a recipe that will make me a Quinoa lover this is it.... Made for PAC spring 08"""
351321,146,7/21/2012,5,"Love this recipe!!  This is the only recipe I use to make quinoa.  I omit the onions, because my husband is allergic.  So I usually add onion powder to make up for the flavor.  I always add more cranberries than the recipe says - just because I think they are delicious."
29782,147,11/5/2007,5,I absolutely LOVED this!! I almost ate the whole thing at dinner by myself :)  YUM! this is one I know I will make many of times. Thank you so much for sharing!
278639,148,2/4/2008,5,"I have made salmon patties from many different recipes, looking for one that I really liked, and THIS IS IT!!  It is my favorite, and so simple.  The saltines are what makes a great improvement in taste over other recipes.  Thanks, Cheri, for posting a winner (and so simple)"
693345,149,9/17/2008,5,"This is a great recipe! I have never made salmon patties before, and I am so glad I chose this recipe! I did add a few things, however. I added a shake of dried parsley leaves from one of the big honkin' containers, which probably equated to about 2 Tablespoons. I also added a couple shakes of paprika, for a little bit of spice (maybe about 1 tsp., or a little less). I also added a shake of garlic powder from the same type of honkin' container (probably about 1 tsp. or so). I don't really measure spices for stuff like this.... I dumped most of the salmon juice (eww...salmon juice) out, but I saved about a tablespoon and put it back in the mixture, just for a tad more moistness. I used canola oil to fry, and I rolled the patties in balls a little bigger than golf balls, then pressed them to about 3/4"" thick. Cooking time was right-on. My husband really liked them, and I did too. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)"
268741,150,3/19/2012,4,These turned out ok - you must SUPER FINELY CHOP the walnuts or the egg just kid of settled on the bottom- would have been good to have that in the instruction - but the taste seemed right for Persian sweets and I will try again next weekend for a Nowruz Celebration - Thank you for the recipe!
1480551,150,3/23/2016,5,"Lovely cookie. Enjoyed by all. Agree with previous reviewer. The walnuts must be chopped very finely. I didn&#039;t have the problem of the egg yolks settling to the bottom, but I think from a texture stand-point more finely chopped walnuts is better."
645231,150,11/28/2008,5,"I made this the other night for dinner and it was fantastic!  I serve it with garden salads and nothing else and it was plenty filling.  The only change I made was using extra cheese (wanted to use up the rest of the block I had), therefore I had to add 2 extra eggs.  I changed nothing else and it came out beautifully!  We love quiche in our house and now we have a new recipe for life.  Thanks Trinkets!"
200862,150,11/5/2011,5,"Trinkets, I apologise for having had to use zucchini instead of spinach -- our only decent shop had neither fresh nor frozen! I liked your recipe for its simplicity and creaminess!! Didn't change anything else (I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk). I hope 5 stars show up, because the new format and colours have me confused! This quiche is soft and creamy, and quite delicious. Next time I WILL do it with spinach. Thanks!!"
2001848839,150,12/10/2017,0,"Five stars for sure! Awesome! Substituted unsweetened almond milk, vanilla flavored, instead of regular milk. You have to try this! Was so moist and best flavor I have tasted. Great recipe! Thanks!"
107583,150,12/5/2009,5,"Delicious quiche!  I didn't use a frozen crust, but did use a ready-made one.  I also made this a bit ""quicker"" by using pre-cooked crumbled bacon.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg, because it is a flavor I like in quiche.  Thanks for a quick, tasty dinner!"
2149976,150,1/16/2012,5,Great summer garden salad !!
487088,150,2/3/2013,5,"Lots of awesome goodness! So easy. I liked Mikekey's idea of using pre-cooked bacon and that did save some time. I always have that on hand. I'll absolutely make this again and next time I plan to thrown in some chopped spinach, I can also see using ham and cheddar cheese with some broccoli. So many possibilities."
461834,150,9/22/2013,5,"Wonderful quiche!!  I made 1/3 of the recipe and used a recipe from my &quot;Small Batch Baking&quot; cookbook for the pie crust which made one mini pie/quiche to serve two.  I served it with some fresh fruit and blueberry muffins, yummy brunch!!  Made for your win in the football pool game, congrats again!!"
176615,150,7/2/2014,5,Good simple to fix quiche. Made my own pie crust and cooked the bacon in the oven. Next time I may use green onions rather than saut&eacute;ed onion. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
2000688819,150,11/17/2015,5,"FANTASTIC!!!! I tweaked it a wee bit:  sauteed onions, mushrooms and spinach.  Then added this to the egg mixture.  Also used bacon chips - which is soy bacon bits.  ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.........."
615758,150,6/24/2018,5,"Made this for dinner last night and had it for breakfast too!! It is very good and easy to make. I had a frozen pie crust, made up the bacon and onion as directed, but I didn't have half and half so I just used 2% milk and it came out fine. I did throw in some cheddar and jack that I had in addition to the swiss and also some chopped spinach. It turned out terrific!! I would recommend to anyone."
655199,152,7/15/2009,3,"This was pretty good, but could've used a little more seasoning IMO...couldn't really taste the Worcestershire sauce. Granddaughter's (7 & 3) loved it! Will make it again, but will add some seasonings. THANKS!"
86318,152,9/11/2003,5,"This is a lovely recipe for hot weather. I cut it back to 1/2 pound tomatoes, which came to about 2 medium ones. It's such a simple recipe, but I don't think I would have thought to do it myself, and now that I've made it, I can think about adding other things...like olives or even anchovies. Thank you, Pat "
121690,153,8/1/2004,5,"Great recipe during the summer tomato-growing season, and wonderful for somebody like me who is avoiding salt. With all the herbs you don't miss it.  I used your recipe as a base, substituting fresh for dried basil, then added in sauteed mushrooms and zucchini and ate it over fettucini.  I'll definitely make it again!"
40114,153,8/5/2006,5,"This really is a lovely recipe. I don't easily give a five-star rating, bit thos one deserves it. Don't hesitate to use more tomatoes if you are a tomato-lover (like I am)."
1198738,153,8/7/2010,4,"DH really liked this.  I thought it was just okay.  However, when there is a plethora of fresh tomatos in the kitchen, this is an excellent way to use them.  Hubby even ate the leftovers cold out of the fridge, and he may have even lickied the bowl!"
362734,153,5/17/2007,5,This was a really fun snack mix. My kids enjoyed it and it kept them busy on a long car ride. This will be great for our hiking trips as there is no chocolate to melt. I used blueberry yogurt cheerios and chocolate teddy grahams.Thanks for this recipe!
285039,153,4/26/2008,5,"What a cute concept!  Never would I have thought of making trail mix with animal cookies and teddy grahams!  I, too, used chocolate Teddy Grahams but used chocolate skittles instead of fruit snacks and peanuts instead of raisins.  Kids love it! Thanks!"
369975,153,8/21/2008,5,A very popular recipe for a office party.  I also used chocolate Teddy Grahams and different character shaped fruit snacks.  Everyone was shocked that it was so good and so easy to make.  I will be serving this again the future.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
326787,153,12/22/2008,4,"Mixed up for a Christmas snack gift for my mother and father, something that sounded not too sweet. I did use the frosted Cherrios and chocolate Teddy Grahams as suggested. This sounded like a good choice, and I think it will be. Thanks..."
85707,153,9/11/2009,5,Easy and so cute!  We are having a family birthday party and there will be several little ones attending.  I made up a batch and tested it on my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter and 18 year old daughter.  They both loved it.
38643,153,9/13/2009,5,My grandkids had fun making and eating this today!
143917,153,10/30/2009,5,This is addictive!! I made it for DD to take on a road trip where it lasted about 20 minutes.  Sent some in a care package to DS with the same results.  Doubled the recipe but next time will have to quadruple!!! Thanks for a sweeeeeeet recipe!
103876,153,7/27/2010,5,"I pulled this up in a hurry today to make a relatively healthy snack-mix for our upcoming vacation.  We used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey roasted peanuts, cheerios, raisins and fruit snacks.  It is very addictive!  Thanks for posting."
29418,153,2/2/2011,5,"I was searching on a snack mix that would be relatively healthy and fun for my three year old as she was getting tired of the same 'ole stuff... So I used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey graham bears, honey nut cheerios, raisins and smiley fruit snacks...  It's very good...I love it and she seems to as well...Thanks for sharing!"
394543,153,12/31/2006,3,"I liked these but they don't rise 
much more than a couple inches
Atleast mine did not."
215969,153,2/6/2006,5,"I've made this twice now. Got it just right the second time. The recipe doesn't specify where to add the tomatoes, so I put them in with the zucchini and other vegies for frying. I found 1 medium to large eggplant and 1 zucchini is about right. The eggplant I diced and sprayed with oil and then microwaved for 4-5 minutes. The vegies I just fried with a bit more spray. The first time I made it I didn't remove enough of the tomato fluid and it came out a bit soggy. The second time I used phyllo pastry and made individual large serve pies. Rave reviews. Thanks so much for the recipe - this is definitely a keeper!."
234075,153,6/21/2008,5,"This was excellent. I microwaved the eggplant, like Andrea-Oz did, and used much less oil overall. Since I had fresh basil on hand, I used that instead of dried. And I had grape tomatoes, so I threw those in. I also used about 2/3 of the amount of cheese, to keep the fat and calories down. 
Finally, I used the Greek Baking Powder Pie Crust, Recipe #146530 , to keep it healthy. Awesome. Will make again. Thank you for posting."
2001782143,153,11/7/2017,5,This exact recipe came from a Betty Crocker Book from the 1970's. I could not find myt book so I checked the web. So happy to find it here. No tweaks necessary. It is perfect.
148715,153,12/30/2006,5,We did a large dinner party for my daughters 17th birthday.  Our theme was Greek and this dip fit the bill.  I shredded the cucumber and squeezed it so it wouldn't make the dip runny.  The dip was a hit and will get made next time I need to do a greek party.
953275,153,7/11/2009,5,"This just goes to show you sometimes DO need a recipe for the simplest of things!!  :)  Thanks Brew, this turned out really well.  I used balkan style (thick) yogurt and still drained it for the day in the fridge.  I also followed your instructions and seeded & chopped as opposed to grating/squeezing like I normally do.  It's really pretty perfect!  Thanks, won't go back now."
1206102,153,2/25/2010,5,"Delicious.  I did have real Greek yogurt, but no dill, so I minced some fresh mint (about 2 T).  Great with baby carrots!"
338384,153,8/15/2011,5,"I just noticed that I never rated this recipe and I must make this at least twice a month!  Seriously, I love this dip, especially with pita bread.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!"
150281,153,10/12/2007,5,"FANTASTIC! I saved this for a special occation and it was a great hit. This is a great recipe for the autumn. My husband loves these, that is a high review in this house. I think this is a recipe that we will be keeping and using again!
Thank you for posting!!
PAC-Fall07"
803717,153,3/31/2008,5,I made these for a sunday special at the restaurant I work at. they are spectacular! I modified it slightly by making my own tapioca pudding (cheaper when you need to make a large quantity) and I substituted carmel extract for the brandy. they were served warm with sauteed granny smith apples on top and drizzled with a homemade carmel sauce....rave reviews from all of my customers!!! thank you so much for the recipe. I will definetely make these again!!!
269521,153,9/3/2009,5,"So simple and very tasty!   I cut the recipe done for two. Instead of canned green chilies, I substitued roasted poblano (diced) and used left over fresh sweet corn!  Also added left over diced chicken to mine (DH doesn't do chicken).  My process was  a little different;  I toasted one side of the tortillas on the griddle, flipped over; then added the filling and folded.  Served with fresh salsa.  YUM!    Thanks for sharing!"
246482,153,7/4/2018,4,Very nice I got 18 muffins out of it but I think my tins were smaller. Next time ill add a bit more coconut or sprinkle a bit on the tops before baking Made for world tour 2018 for the Pantry Pirates.
1145795,153,1/26/2009,5,"For my project on Ethiopia in world history, I chose to make the national dish.  The original recipe I chose called for teff flour but unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere. 

Although I have never eaten authentic injera before, these pancakes came out nice and spongy and delicious!  Plus, the recipe was extremely easy!

5 stars! :)"
1110776,153,5/15/2014,5,Love it!
213139,153,7/19/2009,5,"Made for New Kid on the Block Tag.  These chicken thighs are out of this world.  I originally thought that they would be rather spicy, but they weren't.  Love the color that the cumin put on the meat and you could really taste it.  The only two things about this recipe are ~ the ingredients are not in the order that they are used (might be confusing for a new cook and thus I forgot the cilantro) and the sauce needed to be thickened a little, which I did.  Regardless this is a great recipe and I will use it again!  Thanks for posting this!"
829250,153,7/23/2014,4,"Made this because it looked quick! It was good!!! Didn&#039;t blow me away or anything. Thinking maybe tomorrow it will be better after all the flavors blend. There was a lot of liquid. Tried to add some corn starch to thicken it up but it didn&#039;t do much. Made with a side of beans and sauted red potatoe, zucchini, and carrots. Added sliced avacado too."
1170714,153,6/20/2011,5,This is excellent.  I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough for what I needed.  I also used more powdered sugar than called for because I wanted a thick filling that wouldn't bulge between the layers.  I could eat it with a spoon it's soooo good!
1333844,153,2/26/2012,5,"I tried this filling and it was really good. I made a 1/4 sized recipe to try it and it was a lot, but was it good!? I followed it to the T and it turned out great. Will post pics soon."
63858,153,10/24/2007,5,"This was awesome!  We loved it.  Will definately make again.  The only change I made was I used dried cilantro instead of fresh.  Thanks made for PAC Fall 07.
Lisa"
128541,153,11/21/2010,5,This soup is absolutely the yummiest soup I've had!  So much flavor and so quick!  Thanks for posting it here!
133174,153,11/19/2017,5,A perfect soup for a cool autumn evening. I used rotisserie chicken breast meat and the soup was ready on the table is less than 30 minutes. It is well seasoned and something I am sure to make again.
865936,153,6/12/2010,5,"I made this into individual meatloaves and they were terrific!  I love Mediterranean ingredients.  I always think I don't like mint (in any form), but actually I do!  Thanks for posting.  This will certainly be made again."
1803719199,153,1/28/2015,5,This is my favorite meatloaf. We started buying half a lamb every year. I wasn&#039;t sure what to do with the ground lamb. So off I went to search out yummy things to make. I have made this several times now and it always is a delight for those I share it with. Super easy but oh so tasty. Thank you for sharing this.
2002330544,153,11/13/2018,4,"This is the best meatloaf I have ever made, Moist, flavorful, everyone loved it. Not 5 star because I am just conservative like that."
1235950,153,4/12/2009,3,"I followed the recipe as listed. Full of flavor. The eggs cooked evenly. I laid the steamer bag flat. The texture was spongy throughout and soggy on the bottom. Convenient way of cooking eggs, but I rather use a pan. Thanks."
592157,153,3/3/2010,5,This was simple to make and had a very nice flavor.
1600888,153,4/19/2010,5,Love this soup!  It's so easy to make and is very authentic!  Thank you!
766849,153,8/1/2010,5,"Yum!!!  I think this is the same soup my Korean friend used to order for me (she and the people at the restaurant spoke so quickly I couldn't follow any of it)... it came in individual bowls and we cracked a raw egg into our boiling bowls of soup... a great addition, in my book.  Thanks for posting!"
812019,153,1/25/2009,4,I picked this recipe from Recipezaar at the same time my wife picked it from BH&G. We make it with Chicken tenderloins and serve over rice.
136997,153,1/9/2009,5,"I love caremilzed onions, so I had to try this. Didn't change a thing. Delicious! :)"
160977,153,7/1/2009,5,"This is so good! There were two things that I did not have on hand. Fresh thyme and tomatoes. Solution: used 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme and 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes from a can. Worked perfectly. When the jam was ready it seemed a bit ""wet"", I decided to leave most of the liquid in the pan and scrape the jam together. Wanted to taste it as soon as it was done and found it a bit too sweet. But-once cooled (actually the day after) it was not overly sweet at all, had a jam-like consistency and a zing from the red pepper flakes. A little of this onion jam on a cheese sandwich, mmmmmmmmm.  It has many more uses but I keep putting it on my sandwich, can't stay away from it. Yes, indeed delicious. Thanks for posting."
601528,153,2/19/2010,5,I reduced the recipe by 1/3 with great success.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to chop up the onions instead of slicing.  It was a bit difficult to eat for me.  I thought this was delicious and went well with my tomato and balsamic vinegar chicken that I made for dinner last night.  I slathered this on some homemade rolls.
318262,153,9/18/2011,5,This was delicious! I didn't end up canning or storing any because we wanted to eat it all right away (I scaled the recipe down). I also added a tad more balsamic since I love the stuff and cut down a bit on the sugar. Topped burgers with these lovely onions. Thanks so much for sharing!
2633368,153,5/1/2015,5,"OMG!  This is SO good!  I didn&#039;t&#039; follow the measurements exactly, but it  was delicious!  Sweet and savory. SO good! I definitely plan to make this again! 
I didn&#039;t use tomatoes because I was all out. Maybe I will try with them next time."
323186,153,1/12/2009,5,"My first attempt at Bhaji, and certainly not my last,  these spicy treats were very straightforward to put together and welcomed by my DH who adores spicy nibbles!

That said, they are not overly spicy, so spice-lovers might like to add chopped chillies to this.

I used Pea flour, and I did need more than 1/2 cup of water, closer to a cup, eventually, although I added a little at a time until I had a thick smooth batter.   The veggies add their own liquid, so be sure not to make your batter too runny.

I shallow-fried these, and found they cooked easily, nicely crisp but a good 'spongy'  texture inside, I really was quite impressed!

Thank you for an interesting new experience, Pat!"
585496,153,2/6/2009,5,"Excellent recipe.  If you don't want to deep fry, sauteing also works (though it's not as tasty).

I have found baking the Bhaji, much like the technique you use for Nicoise Socca, also works well.  Mix all the ingredients and add 1/2 t. baking soda.  Put 2-4 T. oil into a non-stick frying pan, then pour in the bhaji mixture.  Bake in a hot oven (425F) for approx 20 minutes.  Serve in 'pizza' slices with a yogurt-coriander dip for an interesting appetizer."
320449,154,5/4/2009,5,"Great flavor!  I followed the baking suggestion, but baked mine for about 30 min. (in a 10"" pan)."
542159,154,7/16/2009,3,Really sorry we just did not like this dish. Tried baking it as recommend by other reviewers. DH liked the taste but not the texture. May be better fried as I think 75% of our issue was the texture itself.
527607,156,10/20/2009,5,"These are fantastic! I bought besan flour at a local indian market before i knew what to do with it, but am very glad i did.  Delicious and so flavorful!"
252514,156,9/2/2011,5,"These were very good. I loved the mix of veggies with the besan (chickpea) flour. They were not overly spicy either, although I did cut half of the chili powder and used curry powder in its place. I shallow-fried these in oil and drained them on a paper bag.  Note: this batter can be made a day a head and kept in the fridge. Served these with Recipe#326538, sauteed baby kale, yogurt, and peach chutney. It was a delicious meal! Thanks, Pat! [Made for I Recommend Tag]"
205750,161,11/6/2018,5,Really loved these. No doubt they can be tweaked according to taste and I am looking forward to making more in the future. I found they were still a bit undercooked in the middle after I fried them but I finished them off in the oven and they were great!
220348,164,5/13/2009,5,"This is for Zaar World Tour 5, and I am a member of the Dining Daredevils. I really love this recipe. I think the combination of nutmeg and fresh parsley is what gives this recipe a nice kick. Although I do have to say that because I love apples, it made it that much easier to enjoy this recipe."
744296,165,5/21/2009,3,Made this for ZWT5. Interesting combination. Didn't have the parsley. This went well with meatloaf.
542159,165,10/11/2009,5,"Tasty! How can you go wrong with cabbage, apples and butter. The nutmeg is a nice addition, how ever fond the parsley a bit distracting. We like parsley but felt that it took a way from all the other wonderful flavors. Made as written and next will do the same leaving out the parsley. Thanks so much for the post."
2324285,167,4/8/2013,5,"I really liked this side dish.  The raisins add just the right amount of sweetness, and although I used chopped cashews instead of pine nutes, I enjoyed that addition too.  A great way to dress up swiss chard- thanks for sharing. [Made &amp; Reviewed for Spring PAC 2013]"
21694,167,10/22/2001,5,"Very good, wonderful dinner during cold nights."
38492,167,4/20/2002,0,"Try this recipe using lamb to make it more authentic,the first time my Grandmother made this was the time i knew this was my favorite comfort food.saute the lamb in bacon,crumble the bacon and follow the recipe.enjoy."
39426,167,4/30/2002,5,"We agree, this was delicious! I would have added more meat and tomatoe but everyone agreed 'don't fix what isn't broken'. Even non-beet-eaters beat us to the pot for more!"
352483,167,6/23/2008,5,"This is my second foray into borscht and have to say this is amazing.  This is easy and fantastic as it stands.  If you like, add additional beef and/or tomatoes but this is a great recipe.  I highly recommend it.  And to think I'd been downright afraid of beets.  Thank you so much!"
459426,167,11/11/2008,4,Really tasty recipe. I added grated carrot too just to get a bit more fibre.  Thanks! :)
41578,167,4/3/2003,5,"I loved the combination of the white cheese and Velveeta!!! This dish is so smooth and creamy.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.  Thanks so much, TinaEmJer.  I have put this in my ""keeper"" notebook.   :-)

162939,167,9/16/2006,5,Pumpkie....This was delious. After trying several recipes for mac & cheese over the years I finially found one that we all loved. Way to go on this fantastic recipe. Thpse kiddo's are lucky to have a mom like you!!!
68460,167,12/20/2003,4,"Good soup!  I used 8 cups of chicken stock (from my freezer stash) and 2 cups water.  For the pasta I used 8 oz. of tri-color tortellini and the rest of the recipe I did as written, using low-fat cream of chicken soup.  Makes a nice big, flavorful pot of soup, we have enough for another meal.  Thanks Darlene, good recipe!"
41578,167,9/20/2005,5,"I have been in a soup mood lately and this certainly hit the spot!  I always have cooked chicken in the freezer and that is what I used for this delicious soup.  The ingredient ratio is perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.  You did it again, Darlene Summers.
"
75497,167,1/8/2008,3,"I loved this, but my daughter and husband would only eat a few bites, so I'm averaging that out to three stars.  I served this alongside mini Recipe #154943.  My raviolini had cheese and spinach in them, so I skipped the broccoli.  It was a great combination of flavors and easy to prepare.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today!"
149342,167,7/5/2004,3,Cook time on the broiling is a little long-- the ends of the legs got slightly burned.  Also a little more Old Bay seasoning (2Tbs) is a little tastier.  
223979,167,1/12/2009,5,Very good!  I love soft shell crabs and always have them in the freezer.  I followed the other reviewers advice about the Old Bay seasoning.  I added a tablespoon to the flour.  They turned out great!  Thanks!
8688,167,6/20/2005,5,"Delicious Pick-Me-Up! I made this using fresh blackberries with no changes to the recipe.  Thanks for a wonderful smoothie recipe, ocurt Schrock!"
59064,167,1/24/2006,5,Excellent recipe and you definitely get enough to make 2 thin crusts which meant I had one for the freezer. Which makes this recipe slightly more economical that most pizza bases as most bases take 3 cups flour per base. Great taste and texture - a good reliable recipe.
176615,167,9/27/2007,5,"Great recipe! I've tried lots of pizza doughs and this one is just wonderful. Very easy to work with. I used half for recipe #221973 and froze the other half for a pizza in the near future. Thanks for sharing your recipe! Made for PAC Fall 2007. Update: Thawed my dough and used it for pizza tonight. Excellent pizza crust! It's so incredibly easy having this ready to go, next time I'll take the chef's suggestions and make a dozen for the freezer. Second update: I made this dough again, this time doubled the recipe and used half white whole wheat flour and half unbleached flour plus a tad bit more water. Worked great for pizza tonight, and I have three dough balls in the freezer for future meals. Thanks!"
130819,167,9/29/2007,5,This makes for a great pizza! Have a really huge pan that is almost oven size - this dough was perfect for the making of a large thick crust pizza. Added all the favorites to top and everyone was happy. I intend to prepare and have crusts in the freezer. Yes will not only be making this again but will be passing around the recipe. Thank you for sharing this pizza crust recipe that has been added to my favorites folder.
253407,167,10/8/2007,5,"This is a very delicious pizza crust!! It was very easy to throw in the bread machine and all the ingredients are what I always have on hand. This dough is very easy to work with. I was very happy to get 2 pizza out of my dough, most pizza doughs only give you one pizza! We usually eat at least one and 1/2 pizzas and DH likes to take leftovers for his lunch! I will be making this crust again, I will have to try freezing it also. Thanks for posting a great recipe!!"
177085,170,10/1/2008,5,"This was so good, and very easy to do. The taste was delicious and was simple for a beginner at making their own pizza dough like me! This made enough for two pizzas so I froze one for later. We eat pizza at least once a week and this is now our recipe! Thanks for a great recipe!"
383346,170,10/25/2009,5,"DH rolled the dough and he told me it was very easy to work with.  And the crust was perfect, great taste.  Thanks FinFan :)  Made for Holiday tag"
289117,170,2/20/2010,5,"Great crust!  I did the prebake on the pizza stone for both crusts and froze one of them.  The other I filled with sauce, cheese, pepperoni and sausage and baked it at 425 for about 14 minutes.  Dee-licious!  Thanks!"
31316,170,8/23/2006,4,"I made this last night.  I had never had or made jambalaya before.  When I was cooking the veggies, tomato paste and 1.5 cups of water, the liquid vanished.  I improvised by adding a cup or so of chicken stock.  In the end, it tasted wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!"
1668373,170,9/26/2010,5,"very easy to make, and much tastier than store bought.  Wonderful!!"
461834,170,9/24/2007,5,"This is delicious and it is low fat!!!  I made one change to the directions, I cooked the onions in a couple teaspoons butter instead of dressing, as I felt the dressing would be too powerful.  I think next time I will cook the onions in the dressing, to keep to the low fat, but then leave the dressing out of the sour cream mixture.  I put the steak in the dressing in the morning to marinade and then grilled it that night.  Thank you for a great recipe nicole!!!!!  Made for PAC."
46357,170,9/15/2008,5,"Oh, this is YUMMY! I followed recipe exactly and it was all good, but the onions sauteed in the dressing were fabulous! I may make all my sauteed onions like this from now on."
1206102,171,12/29/2011,5,"Delicious!  The only change I made was leaving it chunky instead of pureeing, as we prefer our soups more ""stew""-like.  The flavors are subtle and seductive!"

171790,172,11/5/2007,4,I made this for last night's dinner. I used Dijon mustard in place of the dry mustard and I think that next time I'll use fresh garlic. Very tasty. A great way of using up left over pot roast.
46783,172,7/13/2007,5,"A friend from work made this and brought it for the other co-workers to try and everyone loved it!!  It has that caramel apple taste to it. Can't wait to make it for my family.

197277,172,10/17/2007,5,Random... ingrendients.. But very yummy! I had already peeled apples for something else and was out ingredients. I had this I cut it in half. It was very good!
519838,172,10/30/2007,5,yum!! This tastes like taffy apple! Everyone loved it and took some home! Update! I just found out that my friend also added an extra pudding box of butterscotch flavor and some milk.
180898,172,11/3/2008,5,This got rave reviews at my Halloween party from both adults and kids. My 10 year old DD made me promise to make this for the holidays. Thanks for posting.
53368,172,7/5/2009,5,"I've made this before and can agree that it is ZOMG FANTASTIC!  The recipe I used called for added banana slices and mandarin oranges.  Adding those could perhaps justify that it is a TAD more healthy, but of course we all know it's not.  XD  Doesn't change the fact that this is an AWESOME dessert."
1098889,172,12/3/2009,3,I had very high expectations but this was just okay for me.
724631,174,8/31/2008,3,"3 Stars, please see my rating system. I like all the ingredients, and I had never been let down by a TOH recipe, but this recipe as written missed the mark. I shared with my co-workers, and quite a bit was left over. I rated 3 stars because it was too bland, so I would not make it again unless I switched pepper jack cheese for the Monterey jack cheese (wouldn't most families prefer cheddar?), or switched horseradish mustard for the Dijon mustard, or served a bunch of different accompaniments, such as catsup, jalapeno slices, or cheese sauce so people could adapt it to their tastes. On the plus side, this was just the right amount of mix to fill a 13 x 9 pan (see upper left corner of my closeup photo).  A coworker took her piece home and stuffed in Pepper Jack cheese and bacon bits before reheating, and her son declared it a winner.  DH loaded on shredded parmesan cheese and reheated, and enjoyed it very much.  I conclude that one must choose some strategy to add a little zip.  Made for Photo Tag."
133174,175,8/11/2009,4,"The recipe is definitely a perfect after work meal.  The chicken was brushed with the pesto and instead of pan cooking, it was cooked on the George Forman grill.  I had a little difficult with the couscous as I wasn't sure what a sachet was.  I purchase couscous in bulk and attempted to make 2 servings.  It was a little gummy and something I would have to play with to get right.  All in all this is a very well flavored dish that made quick work of getting dinner on the table.  Made for *Aussie Swap*"
583349,175,6/30/2011,5,"This was great!  I loved the lemony twist added to the pesto.  I used spinach instead of arugula because the store didn't have any, but will definitely make again with the arugula.  I used only 1 cup water with 1 cup couscous since I don't know what a sachet is.  Thanks for posting!"
743849,175,6/22/2009,5,"I liked this recipe because it is basic and was easy to adapt to my tastes.  I used 1 15 oz can of red kidney beans and 1 15 oz can of white great northern beans (I drained and rinsed both cans).  I used a yellow pepper from my garden and added a small onion to the mix.  I used spicy sausage (would have been really good with kielbasa, too).  I sprinkled some creole seasoning into the beans while they simmered.  Finally, I served them over steamed basmati rice & garnished with some fresh, chopped green onions (also from my garden).  Delicious lunch!  I GNOME I will make this again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, kellychris!"
68960,175,5/28/2009,5,"Awesome meal with awesome flavour!  This came together in no time at all for a filling, tasty, healthy meal.  Love the addition of the sage, rosemary and celery salt.  Mr Tender I'll put this one into our family members cookbook ;)   book #55856"
355058,175,5/28/2009,5,"Uncle Brent, I didn't know you knew how to cook!  5 1/2 stars from me.  This was very yummy!  I LOVED the nooooodles!!!"
731434,176,5/28/2009,5,Five stars from me!  I ate lots and lots!  I love you Uncle Brent xxx
424680,178,10/18/2011,5,Used Gala apples for these muffins & I was very happy with the results ~ Had some wonderfully moist & flavorful gems that were shared by several neighbors! I really enjoy making these kinds of special treats & do appreciate you posting the recipe! Thanks so much! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this fall's round of Pick A Chef]
705251,180,9/5/2010,4,This is a nicely refreshing beverage.  The flavor is very nice and unusual.  The coffee does not overwhelm the other flavors and the drink still retains its very pink color.  It is definitely going into my saved recipes folder to try again when I have some girlfriends over.  Thanks for sharing in Newest Zaar Tag.
128473,180,10/11/2012,5,"This was a nice coffee, so pretty.  I really enjoyed the subtle strawberry flavor.  The coffee shines thru in a subtle way.  Its rich, thick and creamy.  It was quick and really easy to make.   Thanks for sharing this lovely iced treat.  Made for Think Pink 2012"
25455,180,1/25/2002,5,This has been one of my kid's favorite cakes for many years.
35635,180,8/8/2002,5,"This is so good warm, love the topping..."
138799,180,9/28/2007,5,"Moist and delicious, this cake was so easy to prepare! The only change I made was using half brown sugar and half white. The topping makes the already wonderful tasting cake even more special. Definitely a dessert to serve company! Thank you for sharing! I made this for the Cake-A-Thon in memory of Chef-I-Am."
139930,181,9/29/2007,5,I made this cake for the Cake-A-Thon in memory of Chef-I-Am.  We loved it!  Simple to put together with items I always have on hand.  Cake was tender and moist.  Topping was perfect!  Cake and topping complimented eachother well.  This recipe is a keeper for me!
246197,181,12/18/2007,5,"Made a vegan version of this. I used 2/3 cup applesauce instead of the eggs, margarine instead of butter and soy milk in place of the cream. 
It turned out moist and delicious!!"
583502,181,2/9/2008,2,"this didn't work well for me :(
it was not ""moist"" it was downright soggy. the cake seemed okay when i took it out of the oven, the top and sides were dry and golden and it felt solid but when i put the topping on the margarine seeped into the cake and made it soggy, it also dripped off the top of the cake and went all over my oven. seems to be to much margarine."
2873848,183,3/15/2014,0,Every year for my birthday my mom would ask me what kind of cake i wanted and I picked this one ever time.  Im 57 now and my mom quit making me cakes years ago but I still love this cake.  I believe the recipe is exactly the same.
1802965531,185,9/21/2014,5,"Baked this for our church tea, only used 1/2 the sugar and used Oatmilk instead of Cream or Normal milk in the topping, It was a hit and loved by everyone, including the children."
222433,185,11/12/2006,4,Your right! This is really good. My teen boys loved it as well. The only thing that I will do different next time will be to make a double batch!! Thanks for the recipe!
1056692,185,10/27/2014,4,Very sweet and decadent. I might change the topping next time since my son didn&#039;t care for it. I love how moist this was without being soggy. My only change was to bake in a 9 inch round cake pan. Next time I&#039;ll try to cut back on fat by using applesauce instead of butter and maybe fiddle with the carb count for my diet. I did have some and it was worth the cheat tho. :-)
1363685,186,12/28/2014,4,Very tasty and easy to make!  Just be sure to use a 9 x 9 pan to avoid the dripping situation one of the posters had.  Can&#039;t wait to make it again...with some healthy substitutions and additions!!
1802637236,186,1/9/2015,0,Wonderful!  Lots of childhood memories with this fiber-billed delight.
1802849661,186,2/2/2016,4,"I&#039;d never tried Oatmeal Cake before, but I don&#039;t know why because I am a complete oat addict; I have oatmeal every single day for breakfast and this cake was amazing! I&#039;m not a huge coconut fan, even though the topping was delicious, I preferred it without, but that&#039;s just my taste buds! It&#039;s a great recipe! :)"
1122988,186,5/15/2016,5,Delicious and easy! Will make again!
2001184688,186,2/19/2017,0,I have been making this cake for 50 years and my Mother before. It is a great cake.
2757264,186,1/14/2018,0,Can I use steel cut oats with this recipe??
2002092044,186,4/2/2018,5,This is my husband's favorite &quot;birthday cake&quot;. I got the recipe from his mother when we got married and have enjoyed making it at other times when I want something quick and sweet. It is the easiest cake I have ever made from scratch and is a crowd pleaser at the office or any other get together.
6357,186,7/9/2002,3,"These were good. Since I like to make my cookies larger than the usual sized, this made 32 cookies for me. I did not grease my baking dish as the mixture already had enough margarine in it. I'm not too sure whether cake flour means the same as all-purpose flour ,or if the latter can be substituted for the former. But, I made this using all purpose flour and it was good. Thanks!"
227652,186,7/11/2005,4,This has a yummy vanilla flavoring to it. The cookie is very thin & flat so be sure to drop the cookies 2 in apart so they don't run into each other. I baked mine for 18 minutes since I like my cookies a litte soft on the inside yet crisp on the outside. This made around 4 dozen for me. 
650039,187,1/27/2008,4,Loved these! I use all purpose flour and only a dash of salt as my DH is on a low sodium diet. He loved them too. The go great with recipe #103024 Vanilla Pudding. Will surely be making these often .
1194914,187,7/30/2009,3,"Taste good, but they didn't spread well.  I think they might come out better with butter (in place of shortening).  I used All-Purpose flour..maybe cake flour would make a difference too."
80950,187,3/5/2004,5,I actually have to hide this from my husband when I make it.  This was easy to make if a little messy. I ended up using the Morton's Tender Quick Salt as I was unable to find a substitute.
340445,187,9/11/2006,5,"I was skeptical as I feared I would end up with 5 little baked meatloafs.  But not so.  The Tender Quick gives it the right color and texture.  This was very, very good.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you."
408221,187,12/15/2006,5,"I used more garlic (1 teaspoon per pound of meat) and it turned out phenomenal.  I scaled this recipe up to use 4.5# vension and 1.5 # chuck and the salt content was a bit much.  I will probably only use 4 tbsp. of Tender Quick for 7.5 servings, but it still turned out wonderful."
638020,187,11/5/2007,4,"Loved the recipe, as did everyone who tried it. I will be making this, a lot more often. Do not let the 4 star rating fool you, as I rarely if ever , give anything a 5 star rating. Love the recipe though."
652263,187,11/16/2007,5,"This is a very tasty recipe!
Last weekend was our first time making sausage. We used this recipe, some fibrous casings we bought off the internet, and smoked them in the BBQ for several hours and it turned out great!! It is a little salty at first but as it ages in the fridge the other flavors come though. I would recommend using a little less salt if you don't like allot of salt."
353131,187,1/20/2008,5,"This is an excellent and very easy recipe that gives as good as Hickory Farms results! DD(7) said it was""off the hook"",DD(9) said it was great and DH loved it He wants me to make more to give to some of his friends at work!!"
375730,187,12/1/2008,4,"This was our first attempt at Summer Sausage and it turned out great!  Ours turned out a  little crumbly but we didn't measure exactly so our ratios of meat could have been off.  We also cooked it longer because we were a little nervous at the short cook time.  We mixed everything in a ziplock baggie which worked great!  We found it difficult to get it packed tight enough and are planning to use soup cans as a mold, line them with tin foil and then bake.  Hopefully this works:)
**Note our butcher told us to spray/oil just a soup can pack the meat in and bake it-it should slip out-we are going to try that next."
983307,189,1/23/2009,4,Very easy to make and tasty too.  I used 1 lb. of ground pork with the venison instead of the ground beef.  Thanks for sharing.
326176,190,4/25/2010,5,"Wonderful!  We used all elk meat (no beef) and regular sea salt.  I generally 1/3 the recipe and make 2-4"" long rolls.  Everyone loves the great flavor.  I like the smoker idea that one reviewer had and will make a full recipe and do that next time.  Can never have enough of this in the freezer!  Great to take on camping trips."
1229480,190,12/6/2010,5,"This received rave reviews from my kids and extended family.  Be certain to give the ingredients a few weeks to blend.  We tried it within the first week and thought we'd made a mistake, however, another week or so and we loved it!"
66983,190,11/18/2004,5,"Fabulous!  These are the best brownies I've ever made.  I didnt frost them, didnt think they needed it.  I had never baked with melted chocolate before and it was so easy and tastes so good...I'm throwing that cocoa powder away!  Thanks Evelyn!"
65056,190,9/16/2005,5,"I was really stuck between giving these 4 or 5 stars, but after some thought, I decided that these were just as advertised (plain-old brownies).  These were a bit cakier than I like my brownies, but the top had this lovely crust that developed in the oven (as you can see in the recipes photo) that I really enjoyed.  I tried these fresh out of the oven and wasn't wild about them, but when I tried them the next day once they were completely cool they were much tastier.  I guess that's a good thing- brownies are only warm for so long, so I guess it's good if they're better cooled than warm! lol  The bittersweet chocolate really gives these great flavor, but I do think they're best cooled if you want the full impact of that flavor.  Thanks!"
41578,191,2/12/2005,5,"These are GREAT potatoes!  The only thing I did differently  was to double the amount of garlic...ahhh yes...and used dried tarragon (didn't have fresh.) Can't wait to use fresh tarragon from my herb garden.  I sliced the potatoes VERY thin and it worked out great.  Thanks for sharing, Boca Pat, this will make a repeat performance on our table again and again.
"
117438,191,5/17/2004,4,"These were really tasty and relatively easy to put together. The creaming was a step I am not used to with making muffins, and it did contribute to a cakey texture. I made 6 mega muffins and cooked them for 30 minutes. I also ran out of butter and had to use a little marg. Streusal is something I had not heard of before and even though I forgot the cinnamon, it really added a nice crunch. I also used frozen blueberries about 5 - 6 per muffin. Overall, very nice recipe. "
198601,191,9/3/2008,0,"These had a great flavor.  Not too cupcakey, although sweeter than typical homemade muffins.  Used almond extract instead of vanilla and would recommend that."
125636,191,7/31/2009,0,These did not turn out very well for me..they were so soft that I couldn't get them out of the pan. They were very very tasty though...so i would bake it as a cake ..but not as mini-muffins.
162398,191,9/26/2004,5,Def wouldnt make this for guests but he was severely hung over and it worked better than mcdonalds! Thanks.
190336,191,1/25/2005,5,OK - VERY GOOD HANG OVER FOOD! Better than a fag and Big Mac!
335363,191,7/31/2006,0," *****
Thanx soooo much for a grt recipe.My 3yr old asked for seconds-served twice this week-end for breakfast.I served it with sausages.
31/07/2006"
435938,192,1/28/2007,3,I made this for my very picky son - first time I tried I was out of milk and used dry milk. He did not like this! Next time I used fat free milk and he said it was good.
191809,192,4/16/2007,5,This was great!  I used cooked fajita-seasoned bell peppers and onions in place of the onion powder and the whole dish was really good.  I made wraps and really enjoyed this!
245429,192,12/31/2006,1,"Sorry, but we just didn't think too much of this recipe."
430471,192,11/19/2007,5,"These were outstanding. But who could go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter. I made a lower fat version of these, but will make the real thing at Christmas time.
I did have to use chocolate chips, because the store was out of the M&M's and I used almonds cause I was out of pecans."
8688,192,12/22/2007,5,"The perfect Christmas cookie!  I love the peanut butter and oatmeal combination!  I used old fashioned oats, pecans and regular sized M&M's which worked perfectly well.  I had to bake just a bit longer for the sides to bake, but I think my cookies may have been a touch more over the  1/4 cup.  Thanks again, Boomette, for another wonderful recipe : )"
166642,192,9/9/2008,5,These are delicious cookies. I used peanuts and regular-sized M&Ms. My family enjoyed these a lot and I will make them again.
491095,192,9/10/2008,5,I know these as Monster Cookies and they are GREAT!!
37305,192,12/1/2008,5,"Absolutely FABULOUS!  Temp, time and yield are right on (I did get 27 cookies instead of 26!) I used quick cooking oats and instead of adding nuts, I used crunchy peanut butter.  These cookies didn't turn out quite as wide as I thought they would (because they don't spread much), but they are nice and chunky plus chewy.  Really delicious!  These are definitely going on my Christmas trays this year...thanks! Update 12/01/08: I made these last night with Old Fashioned Oats instead of Quick Cooking Oats.  This time they spread A LOT!  I'm wondering if the quick oats absorb some of the wetness of the mixture, more than the old-fashioned do.  Either way, these are delicious cookies!"
303700,192,1/8/2009,5,"Made for Photo Tag. These bake up beautifully all toasted oats and peanut buttery flavour! I added a triple whammy by using Reeses peanut butter chips. As soon as I get a working camera,I will make them again and get a pic.
1/8/09
I made these again now that my camera is home again. :)
I used chocolate chips in place of M&M's and lots of peanuts leftover from Christmas.
they turned out just as nice as last time. Sorry it took so long for the pic, Boomie."
29655,192,3/3/2009,5,Great way to get oatmeal cookies into the kids.  I got absolutely no complaints!  I made them as listed without the chopped nuts but with chocolate chips.  They were a hit!  Thanks for a winner!
444132,192,5/19/2010,5,"Excellent cookies that are easy to make, and a real crowd pleaser!  I made these with regular M&M's, of which I only had 3/4 cup, so I used chocolate chips for the remainder.  The nuts I used were peanuts, which I thought would amplify the M&M aspect of the cookies.  These will definately go on my ""make again"" list!  Made for Sweet Traditions Tag.  Thanks for posting, Boomette!"
2000271443,192,6/15/2015,0,"Oh, forgot to add, NO FLOUR in this recipe???"
169430,192,9/2/2009,5,"I truly hate the tomato soup that you get in cans and have as far back as I can remember. When I saw this recipe I just had to try it and I'm so glad that I did. It's wonderful! I skipped the sugar, it truly wasn't needed and I had red bell pepper so that is what I used. The chunks of tomato, pepper and onion with the fragrant and flavorful herbs make an outstanding soup. At last, a tomato soup that actually tastes Great! Made for Photo Tag."
428885,192,1/18/2010,5,"Yep, that's right. This is one quick, pow-pow tasting soup. Easy as the flick of a light to put in the pot, and sitting down to enjoy the afternoon writing, reading, or relaxing. I followed exactly, using green pepper, and all the other ingredients which were so important to make this taste so smooth, so delicious, and so refreshing. I used fresh thyme from my green house, minced up and put right in. Served with toasted bread on top, where you can slurp up the bottom and make sure you have all the soup out of the bowl! Perfect! Will make again! Made for *Diabetic Forum* Soup's On January 2010"
157425,192,11/4/2010,5,"Fantastic tomato soup, so much better than the canned stuff! I used unsalted butter, vegetable broth, a red pepper, and petite diced tomatoes. Couldnt wait for the soup to finish cooking, it smelled and tasted great. Sliced a couple pieces of sourdough bread to go with the soup and enjoyed my lunch! Will definitely make this again it will be perfect on a cold winter day. Made and reviewed for Kittencal's Recipe Tag Game."
171790,192,4/5/2011,5,Wow! This has so much flavor! We loved it. It was served as written as a first course with tonight's dinner. I added some Creole chicken to the remainder. That will do for lunches for the next couple of days. Made for Kittencal's Recipe Tag Game.
869184,192,5/23/2011,4,We found this soup to be more like a minestrone than a tomato soup; I think that the bay leaf and sugar make it more mellow that a typical tomato soup. The tomato was not the predominat flavour which we had anticipated
498271,192,1/8/2013,4,"Great easy, tasty and inexpensive soup!  I used more than a dash of cayenne for a little extra heat.  Yummy and low-cal as is, I think it would be great with some chicken or turkey sausage added as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
870705,192,1/12/2013,5,This makes a delicious  soup.  I substituted 1 teaspoon of Creole seasoning for the spices but for us the tomatoes were a little to chunky......next time I would try mashing them up some but that's a matter of individual taste.  It was very easy to make.  Made for Football Pool 2012.
482376,192,7/22/2013,5,I loved this soup!! The flavors are absolutely perfect and I had no need to adjust the seasonings. I ended up blending mine until smooth. I will definitely be making this often. Thank you! Made for ZWT0 and the Soup-A-Stars
179133,192,2/26/2014,5,"I subbed orange pepper for the green and used vegetable broth. Otherwise followed the recipe but threw it in the blender once it was done cooking as I prefer a smoother tomato soup. Served with garlic toast, it made for a rather tasty dinner. Thanks for sharing!"
865936,192,3/17/2013,4,"I love the dressing for the rice salad and definitely use the sriracha. My chicken came out perfectly cooked and moist, but I think it would have benefited by being pan-seared before being placed in the oven.  Made for PAC."
560491,192,5/22/2013,5,"This was very good and light tasting!  I didn&#039;t use the sriracha but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did take threeovens&#039; advice and pan seared the chicken a little, made it look and taste amazing.  Will make this again!  Made for PRMR."
157425,192,6/18/2006,4,"This was a nice dip that needed just a bit of zip. I chopped the artichoke's rather small and omitted the salt as the parmesan cheese was salty enough for us. Next time I would use less parmesan, add some herbs, and maybe garlic and green onion."
731027,192,1/20/2008,4,This is how I like with NO mayo like so many recipes call for. I usually add about 1T or so minced garlic & sometimes about 1/2tsp dillweed....just perfect!!!
412530,192,4/3/2010,5,THIS IS THE ONE!  There are so many Mississippi Mud's on the site but most of them have a graham cracker crust. I don't care for it. This is the best crust with this desert. I couldn't find my old recipe but am happy to find yours with the same combination. Thanks for sharing.
1613349,192,6/21/2014,5,Yummy!  I used Tzatziki Sauce instead of greek dressing and added some hearty olives to the mix.  So refreshing on a warm summer night and easy to pack for a picnic.
267506,192,11/26/2005,2,"Was looking for a new version of my husband's favorite.  The cake had an overwhelming taste of alcohol, probably 1/2 C is too much Kirschwasser.  The frosting was very good however, we had to throw the whole thing out."
59144,192,2/14/2006,5,"DessertQueen, I made this recipe for my Mom and my Fiance' for Valentines Day, I added the drained Cherries to the batter and made it in a Bundt Pan. I drizzled Cream cheese icing on it & topped it with Chocolate Chips and Marischino Cherries and It was delicious!
Definetly a Keeper!
Thanks!"
56112,194,10/8/2006,5,"I knew that I would love this....I just wasn't sure that the family would...but they did.  It got a ""thumbs up"" all the way around the table.  I did add a few chopped mushrooms....I think you put mushrooms in everything!!!"
247368,194,5/11/2008,5,This is the simplest recipe for this dessert on Recipezaar at the moment. I followed it to the T and it tastes just like the dessert I love so much in the restaurants.
347922,194,4/25/2009,5,SOOO good. Now I can have my favorite dish from Berkeley's Thai Temple without having to travel thousands of miles!
1251273,195,12/22/2009,5,Thanks for a quick & easy recipe.  Made it a few times and found it absolutely scrumptious!!!  The different flavours blend in so well together.  I sometimes drain the artichoke oil to make it a bit healthier.
794242,196,1/26/2010,5,This is my all time favorite recipe that you have posted all of the flavors blend together so that it's like a party in your mouth!  Our family LOVED it and my daughter had 3 helpings of it and she never even gets second helpings.  Both of my kids asked me to make this sometime soon!
870928,197,2/28/2010,5,Loved this! Looking for something easy to cook for dinner and this was perfect! I will be putting this in my permanent file. GREAT MEAL!
96177,197,5/17/2009,5,"Dh and I loved his recipe. I didn't process in the blender as directed, in stead we added the drained ingredients into the skillet and added some cornstarch to thicken. Very good burrito. Made for ZWT5!!"
2083567,198,4/3/2013,5,"This is a keeper. I cut the recipe in half, other than that followed the recipe as prescribed, there was no need to process in the blender.Shredded the beef and put it back in the pot. The flavor was spot on! Leftovers were even better. Served w/rice and beans."
222564,198,4/2/2014,5,Grand as is!
138799,198,9/16/2008,5,"Delicious little buttery cookies that melt in your mouth! They're a snap to whip up because the cookie press does all the work! I made just a half batch and easily got over 4 dozen cookies, but lost exact count cuz I was samplin them! I look forward to using this recipe for the holidays and play with the different shapes, colors, and decorating them! Thanks for sharing your recipe tina rose!:)
Made for PAC Fall 08"
537179,198,9/24/2009,5,"Awesome! These were so good. Reminded me of those little danish cookies you can get around Christmas in the tin cans. I had never ever worked with a cookie press before, I'm so glad I tried this recipe. They were enjoyed by all. I'll be making them again. Made for PAC Fall 2009"
922195,198,12/24/2008,5,"This is really delicious and a crowd pleaser.  Made it for a Christmas party and the colors are quite festive, although I'll be anxious to try this in the summer when tomatos are in season and even more delicious."
318235,198,3/24/2010,5,"I had gone to post this awhile ago from my ATK cookbook and I saw you already beat me to it!This is excellent, though I did make a few changes in processes which I hope you don't mind. I only used one sheet of puff pastry and just smoothed the folds with my fingers. Then rather than cut off the side pieces I just folded the outside in about 1/2 inch the whole way around. I did poke thoroughly before baking but it puffed up a lot, which really didn't end up being a problem, I was just surprised by the size of it lol. To the tomatoes I added salt as well as sprinkled them liberally with garlic powder. Even though the pastry was all puffed up I just laid the tomatoes on top and once it baked the juices deflated the pastry a little. This was so yummy. I served it as a side to a steak salad and it made a perfect dinner. Thank you for the recipe!"
1041500,198,12/10/2008,5,"I made this recipe tonight and my son, a 6 yr old- who is a very picky eater loved it! Thank you so much for sharing."
1083594,198,12/18/2008,4,Delicious!
369715,198,4/8/2010,4,This was good an easy to make. I followed the recipe as written except that added some pepper to the mixture. I used a can of peas and carrots instead of mixed veggies. We all enjoyed this. Made for Spring PAC 2010.
1358170,198,8/20/2009,5,Everyone I have fed this too has gone absolutely CRAZY over it. I'm making it tonight for the 5th time in a month =)
424680,198,5/29/2010,5,"Really enjoyed working with the mustard seeds here & will have to find additional recipes in which I can use them! Glad that I didn't cut the recipe in half, because although there were just 2 of us for eating these beans, they didn't last but about 2 meals! Really enjoyed the combo of the seeds & the seasonings here! Definitely a keeper of a recipe! [Made & reviewed while in Asia with ZWT6]"
527886,198,5/31/2010,3,"Very mild. I would double the ginger and coriander, even for kids, just to have some taste beyond basic green beans. I only used 2 tbl of oil, and that was still way too much for this amount of vegetables. I would suggest the barest amount to saute the mustard seeds."
383346,198,5/31/2010,5,I used 2 tablespoon of canola oil.  And I used 1/2 cup green onion.  I didn't use salt.  I simmered the veggies near 12 minutes to have the green beans tender.  Cause I don't like when it's still crunchy.  This is really good with the lemon juice.   Thanks Momaphet :)  Made for the Zwizzle Chicks of ZWT
107135,198,6/1/2010,5,"ok i used canned beans  cooked carrtos 1st . cut down oil added drained beans last . i didnt add salt , personal for me . i know this would be great with fresh beans but was good with the canned  try this recipe .zaar tour 6"
895132,198,6/1/2010,5,"I had to use sweet potato instead of the carrot, but they do taste quite similar, so I don't think this makes such a great difference. Wonderful easy, quick and tasty green bean dish - I love green beans, and this definitely is a way I will eat them again! Thanks for posting.
Made for the Unrulies Under the Influence on ZWT6 Germany / Asia."
29655,198,6/2/2010,5,"Easy, quick dish with ingredients I already had on hand.  I loved this preparation for green beans.  I did use onion powder instead of fresh onion.  It was good but next time I'll use fresh onion.  The lemon juice really adds to the flavor.  Thanks for posting.  This is definitely a keeper.  Made for ZWT6."
844554,198,3/13/2011,5,Very good beans. Loved the spices and it's the first time for me using mustard seeds. I cut the recipe down for hubby and me and shouldn't have... we wanted more!! Made for PAC Spring 2011.
143721,198,8/17/2012,5,Great new way to do green beans.  I really like the mustard seeds in this dish.  Made for ZWT8 and The Wild Bunch.
166642,198,8/18/2012,5,"I love green beans and these were delicious. Loved the flavors and it was really quick and easy. Made for ZWT8 for the Diners, Winers and Chives team."
690623,198,8/14/2017,5,An excellent treatment for green bean. I will be making these often. Thanks for posting! Made for CQ4
227978,198,8/15/2017,5,"This was an excellent way to prepare green beans. I loved the bit of a kick from the mustard seeds. I'm glad I chose this recipe. It was really good. Thanks, momaphet. Made for Culinary Quest 2017 (Himalayas)."
226863,198,8/15/2017,5,I believe this may be one of the best green bean recipes I've had lately! We will definitely make it again. Even the non-green bean eaters ate this recipe. Thanks for sharing! Made for CQ 2017 for the Smok'in Chefs.
305531,198,8/20/2017,5,"We really enjoyed these beans. Simple but good. Thanks for sharing, Linda. Made for CQ4."
482376,198,2/9/2018,5,Really good beans and carrots! I loved the extra flavor boost. Thank you! Made for the Best of 2017 tag.
88378,198,7/25/2012,5,"Very good - we all enjoyed this.  I used just 1 jalapeno, and I omitted the ginger altogether because the heat level was perfect... which is to say plenty spicy.  I found it easy to mix the coconut milk and cornstarch right in the can with a slim whisk (save washing a bowl).  Next time I will add a little more basil to the dish.  This is a winner!"
2114486,198,7/4/2013,3,"I&#039;d suggest using green curry paste, rather than curry powder, for a fresher and more authentic flavor.  If you can&#039;t find Thai basil, again I&#039;d suggest using  regular fresh basil rather than cilantro."
900992,198,10/2/2013,3,"We added an extra jalapeno pepper and used Thai basil, but we found this borderline bland. It needs much more heat and flavor. I would probably throw in 2 or 3 Thai peppers if I were to make this again."
40804007,198,8/28/2013,4,"These crackers had a great flavor, but I made mine from regular almond flour and they were much darker in color than the ones shown. They froze really well too!"
2001676733,198,8/18/2017,5,This is my third time making this recipe. It's yummy!
956121,198,9/14/2008,5,"These muffins turned out fluffy, weren't too sweet and didn't stick to the pan.  I used 3 large bananas."
107583,198,9/18/2008,4,"These are very good, not too sweet (I used Splenda).  You should list Splenda in the ingredients list (it won't ""distort"" the numbers, since Zaar does not recognize it as an ingredient, but it would be less likely to be left out by someone not reading closely.  Also you have no oven temperature listed.  I baked mine at 350F.  I will be making these again, but will add some cinnamon and nutmeg also.  Made for Fall 2008 PAC."
962521,198,10/21/2008,4,"I thought they were great, though my sister didn't."
28649,198,7/29/2002,5,This was very simple and very refreshing.  This is perfect for this warm weather.  Thanks for recommening this Merlot.
30298,198,7/30/2002,4,Light and refreshing!  I used a reduced fat graham crust and light cool whip and still had a tasty treat!
87300,198,6/22/2003,5,"This is such a perfect summer dessert, and SO easy, too!! I made it as a strawberry lemonade pie, as my DH loves strawberries; I used 2 teaspoons Crystal Light (sugar-free) lemonade mix (same amount of water), light vanilla frozen yogurt (2 cups, which I think is a pint!), Cool Whip Free, and a Keebler reduced fat graham cracker crust (I couldn't find the larger size, but the regular one worked fine -- I just piled it on!). Then I sliced some strawberries into a bowl and crushed a few soft ones and sprinkled on a tiny bit of Crystal Light lemonade mix and stirred, then topped the pie slices with it. It was SO good!! And it reminded me a little of cheesecake, which I love. I recommend the strawberry topping if you like strawberries, as it added great color and flavor. The way I made it, I figure it as 4 Weight Watcher points (about 200 calories) per serving, for 8 servings. Thank you, Merlot!!!"
22973,198,8/11/2003,5,"Merlot,
  I took the ingredients for making this rcipe with me when we went camping last week,Soooooooooo GLAD I did,It was 95 in the shade andI made these.Ohhhhh My Gosh!!
These were so cool and refrehing,and so easy to make.Yum!!! Thanks so much,
Darlene Summers"
37449,198,8/31/2003,5,So easy and so good! My husband and son scarfed this up!
89831,198,3/15/2004,5,"Merlot...this is the second time that I made your lemonade icecream pie, it is so light, yummy and refreshing, my Dh just loves lemons..we had some company over tonight, so I made two of them in the morning and stuck them in the freezer (I will keep one for DH and myself).... they just raved about it, I sent home the recipe with one person, this is such a delicious pie, I can't wait to serve this at my BBQ parties this summer, this is winner, thanks so much for posting Merlot :-)"
101034,198,6/15/2004,5,"What a great tasting, refreshing dessert this is. It was heavenly. Everyone enjoyed it. I used a chocolate cookie crumb crust,  lite cool whip and sugar free country time. It was SOOOOO good. No one had any idea it was sort of low cal. Thanks Merlot"
95810,198,7/8/2004,5,This pie is so easy and so delicious!  I made a strawberry lemonade flavored one and used some strawberry cool whip with it.  Very good.  I also made a plain lemon one.  This is a perfect summer dessert.  Very light and refreshing. Thanks for the great recipe!
107308,198,7/17/2004,5,"Such an easy and delicious pie! We really liked the light texture and delicate taste of lemon.  I think one could add more of the lemonade mix for more intense lemon flavor.  I used a mild chocolate graham cracker crust (not the dark chocolate one) and topped with shavings of Hershey bar.  The pie looked lovely!  I am now wondering if this would work with the fruit flavored lemonade mixes?  Thanks Merlot, for such a nice dessert recipe!"
130819,198,7/25/2005,5,Added this one to my dessert table awhile back and it was an absolute hit with my guests. It is a perfect summer dessert. Since we love 'lemon everything' I already have requests that this be one of the desserts at our next gathering!  Thanks for sharing a recipe we all enjoyed.
229524,198,5/21/2006,5,"So easy to make and so tasty. Made Uncle Bill's Turkey (462620) for dinner and this was a very nice, light dessert to have.   "
130896,198,7/25/2006,5,"I tried this recipe because it sounded so easy, almost foolproof, and it turned out great.  It was very refreshing and not too heavy and disappeared quickly.  Thanks-Joan"
195175,198,5/21/2007,5,"I found this recipe in the new Kraft Food and Family Magazine and was going to post it, but I found you had already done so. Thank you Merlot. This is a great, and very tasty summer pie. I like that you can always have the ingredients on hand. I used lite ice cream and cool whip to cut calories. Yummy."
231054,198,10/25/2007,5,"I love this -- and idea behind it.  I'm sure you could use other flavors and still come up with a very refreshing and easy to throw together dessert!  I had Crystal Light lemonade powder and used it.  BUT I think I should have cut back to probably about half of the 1/3 cup.  It's VERY lemony!!  I used no sugar added vanilla ice cream and the lite Cool Whip.  I loved reading the other reviews -- and have picked up some good ideas from those chefs.  Thank you, Merlot, this is a fantastic recipe."
28201,198,5/25/2008,5,"This review is about a year too late!  I made this last summer, and loved it so much I must have made it a dozen times.  I'm hosting a grill out tomorrow for Memorial Day and I lost my written copy, so I logged on and saw that I never reviewed it!   This has just the right amount of lemony ""tang"" and yet it is so light and refreshing.  I also splurge and use Hagen-Daaz vanilla ice cream.  I'm sure I'll make this a lot this summer too!  Thanks Merlot!"
811602,198,6/24/2008,5,Terrific and easy recipe. I keep the ingredients on hand so that I always have a good dessert to take to someone's house. Everyone always asks for the recipe.
250031,198,6/26/2008,5,"Wonderful! Made this for my husband's birthday on this hot, humid summer day. Very refreshing, very easy--very nice!"
29404,199,7/1/2008,5,"What a tasty surprise.  I love it when super easy recipes taste super good.  TY so much for posting.  This will be a ""do-again"" and again, and again..........."
297380,199,7/9/2008,5,What a wonderful recipe for these hot days we are having.  Next time I will make 2 or 3 and freeze them to have handy.  Thanks for sharing!
381411,199,7/16/2008,5,We really loved this!   Very refreshing for the summertime.  I can't wait to make it again!     Thanks!
64583,201,7/1/2009,5,What a delicious pie!  I give it 5 stars even though for some reason my husband and kids weren't overly fond of it.  I've decided they must be crazy!  That's the only possible reason for not loving this pie!   Thanks for posting!
870928,201,9/17/2009,5,"OMG we loved this! Served to 4 people and everyone raved.  My DH said I can make this anytime.  Cool, creamy, and fantastic! Very easy to put together too.  This will become a favorite I'm sure of it!"
470894,201,4/27/2010,5,"so simple to put together and very refreshing.  I did add a bit more lemonade powder for a little more tang.  Use good quality ingredients and let them speak for themselves. In this case, less is more.  Thanks for the great recipe."
666947,201,6/6/2010,5,"This recipe is so simply and delicious! I used Strawberry Lemonade mix instead of regular and it was amazing. Thanks for sharing, this recipe is a keeper!"
804490,203,7/3/2010,5,"So easy and delicious!  Like another reviewer, I used sugar free lemonade mix - 3 teaspoons; same amount of water; and light homemade vanilla ice cream with sugar free cool-whip.  It was excellent!"
570804,203,7/26/2010,5,"What a simple and wonderful frozen pie - I thought that it might be too big for just the 2 of us but afraid I was wrong.   Disappeared in a couple of days.  Thanks for something easy, wonderful and light tasting."
791227,203,7/27/2010,5,"I have been making this recipe for years and it is always requested; especially in the hot summer months. Instead of instant, I use 6 oz. of frozen lemonade concentrate, and sometimes even deepen the hue with yellow food coloring. I also, ocassionally, make individual pies in the mini graham cracker crusts. This way, those not used are available for future desserts and their presentation remains intact."
257968,203,4/10/2011,4,"I also used frozen lemonade concentrate--a 6 oz. can, softened.  I also used slightly softened ice cream--2 cups.  I did have too much filling for my crust, but I just froze the extra for a snack.  Delicious, easy, and refreshing!"
195589,203,5/10/2011,5,"O Yummmmm!! LIke another reviewer, I used frozen lemonade concentrate. Since we are having a heat wave (in Feb.) here in CA, I made this a few days ago, and it was perfectly light and delicious! Thanks for posting, Merlot!  : )"
2001513060,203,4/29/2017,5,"This was a wonderful dessert. Just the right amount of lemon flavor. I made individual tarts, they came out cute and tasty!!!!"
61660,203,11/20/2002,5,"Most time consuming part was dicing the meat, but sure was worth it!  Everyone raved about it and I have already had requests for more."
323120,203,8/31/2006,5,This was dead on the the money.Almost the way my Babcia taught me.She never used Lamb or beef .It was too expensive!!!! Her insistance.
141293,203,4/18/2009,5,"Kim127 made this for Easter and was nice enough to give me a serving.  It is sooo delicious!!  I am making my version this weekend for my parents and I know they will love it.  I will be using lamb, beef, chicken and kielbasa."
45833,203,4/5/2003,5,DEEE-licious!!! My husband says it deserves 10 stars!! He asked for a piece.. then changed it to several pieces--for his bag lunch. I will be making this often!! I followed the recipe exactly--except for the pecans as I didn't have any. Thanks for posting!! :)
109395,203,10/26/2003,5,"This is a really easy cake for special events. Have made it for years. Try chocolate butter fudge cake mix with pecans and/or coconut in the topping part. The recipe we used didn't call for pecans, but I love them and add them as often as I have them."
10113,203,12/26/2005,5,this was a big hit in my christmas gift baskets the fist thing gone
366864,203,10/19/2006,5,"My mom use to bake a cake just like it she called it The Ugly Cake,this brought so many great memories!!!!!!!Try it, you'll fall in love!!!!!!!"
338672,203,12/5/2006,5,Just like the ones I used to eat when I lived at home. I'm so happy I found it again.
352814,203,1/7/2007,4,"Extremely sweet (a little too much so for my taste-just personal preference).  I also was expecting it to be a little more ""ooey gooey.""  However, it is very yummy."
473806,203,12/17/2007,5,Love this spin (nuts) on an old family favorite of mine.  Thanks for the awesome recipe revival.  EVERYONE who tried this loved it and wants the recipe.  Don't worry I'm giving you all the credit!
231507,205,4/29/2012,5,"Been making this for years, but could not find my recipe today. Made for a trivia fundraiser tonight and it was enjoyed by all at our table. Thanks Georgia Peach for posting!!"
1802878096,206,7/2/2014,0,"Not thrilled, my husband liked it but it was not near as good as that from my local grocery store! No crunch in the crust and no gooey center.... A little dry...... But again my husband liked it so not a complete failure!!!"
5060,207,6/16/2010,5,"Very flavourful chicken!!  we loved the basil and garlic and the prosciutto was a wonderful addition; the Parmesan was a perfect finish, thanks for posting I will be making this one again."
136997,209,8/29/2010,5,Absolutely delicious. I used fresh basil from my garden. :)
50472,210,12/19/2003,5,"Oh, I have eaten way too many of these!  They are addictive!  It was super simple to make.  The nuts turn out very glossy and shiny.  They look beautiful in a glass jar.  I must give these away before I eat them all!   "
47892,210,11/16/2007,5,"'Melon, I uses this recipe to caramelize hazelnuts and it worked beautifully. Do heed the warning in step #7 to avoid burning the nuts. Used local honey and Oregon grown hazelnuts. A million grazies!  cg ;)"
1091591,210,12/22/2008,5,"I made this recipe for the first time tonight and I have to say it was one of the easiest party/snack foods I have ever made, and they taste awesome!
 The Second batch I did however add a little cinnamon(about 1/4 teaspoon) and it was great both ways.
Thanks a bunch W.M.
Kudos"
1215879,210,3/25/2009,5,quick & easy...great in salads.
125356,210,1/16/2012,5,To dye for!
620435,210,11/23/2007,5,This was the most tender pulled pork ever.  The foil is the secret as it keeps the top of it from drying out.  I added a bottle of barbque sauce to the ginger ale so both cooked together.  The meat just fell apart and shredded very easily.  I then mixed in more barbque sauce after shredding.  Everyone love it.  Thanks for sharing this.  I may use the foil method when cooking beef in the crock pot as well.
765036,210,1/28/2009,5,I have made this recipe several times.  It is a favorite around my house.  my boyfriend loves it and we often have friends over when we eat it.  our favorite restraunt is sonny's bbq and this is just as good and alot cheaper.  thanks!
643099,210,2/4/2010,5,There is only one word for this pulled pork: FABULOUS!!!! It was incredibly simple to make and absolutely impossible to resist! I can't wait for those summer barbecue parties!
347441,212,6/16/2010,5,My son loves pulled pork but can't have barbecue sauce.  This has become his favorite way of having his pulled pork.   So simple to do.  Have used rootbeer and not enjoyed as much as this recipe.
1016302,213,7/24/2010,5,Simple and easy! After I pulled the pork apart I put it back in the crock pot with BBQ sauce for 1-2 hrs. Will use this recipe again!!!
1340977,215,3/12/2011,5,Two words...simple and DELICIOUS! Thanks for posting.
1181842,215,11/13/2012,5,"My family loves this recipe! Very tasty. The only variations i make are to cut up an onion in the bottom and set the roast directly on top of them (no foil). After 12 hours I remove the onions, shred the meat, add the bbq sauce and cook on low another 3-4 hours. My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to cook."
199631,215,7/3/2006,5,I have made this many times and got rave reviews
124190,215,5/20/2007,5,"These were very,very good. I made them on my indoor grill, and they turned out great. Very juicy. I did use a little less salt. I did have some trouble keeping them together, but I think that was my fault. I don't think I worked them meat togther quite enough. Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely make again!"
567134,216,6/22/2008,5,These came out very juicy and tender.  This is a keeper !
278113,216,7/22/2009,5,"I really enjoyed these burgers!  We made two different recipes, and these were by far the best. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
322381,223,1/31/2007,3,"Very easy to make, very economical and it smells great when cooking. I don't know that we'd make it again, but it is a good recipe to modify to your tastes, like Silverjazz says. Love the addition of cayenne, and we put a lot. One thing though- I felt that it was more than 3 servings, just because it yields a whole lotta sauce!"
53959,223,1/29/2007,5,These were really good. I had a ham already in the oven so this worked out perfectly. Everything was done at the same time. I loved the cinnamon flavor of the yams. Thank you for this great recipe.
412186,224,11/8/2007,3,"Very good, easy to make."
326787,224,9/6/2007,4,"These are good, but maybe just a little too sweet for us. I only had 1 cup of cinnamon candies so that was all I used and they were still really sweet. Next time I will cut down on the sugar or maybe the candies. Just a note: We ate leftover potatoes a couple of days later and they did not seem quite as sweet after reheating."
803511,224,7/30/2008,5,Oh Twis...these are tasty.  I knew I would like them being a huge sweet potato fan and the cinnamon candies were such an interesting twist.  I ate them with a ham steak for dinner and then had another serving for dessert!  I think I might toss some toasted pecans in with my leftover potatoes.  Thanks for the fun treat.
297272,224,5/2/2007,5,"These were the best bran muffins I've ever made!  I ran out of applesauce so I used a small (mashed) banana instead of 1/4 cup of it.  I also replaces the brown sugar with 1/4 cup honey and added chopped dates!!!  SOOO moist, and the sweetness of the dates worked amazingly well with the honey flavour!"
356476,224,7/23/2007,4,"These were pretty good for ""healthy"" muffins.  I followed the recipe, but added 1 chopped apple, 1/4 cup raisins, 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts, and an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed them as much if I hadn't added the extras.  I had to leave them in for almost 20 min, but maybe that's because of the extras. Thank you for the low fat/high fibre recipe!"
604139,224,1/22/2008,5,"These are a yummy, healthy muffin. I altered the recipe a bit: I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, added 2 tsp baking powder, used 2 cups unprocessed bran, 1/4 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 cup raisins, and left the rest of the recipe as-is. They came out really well-the perfect amount of moistness, not too sweet but not tasteless at the same time. Thanks for a great recipe! I will definitely make these again."
1923002,224,6/2/2011,5,"Awesome, my whole family loves them.  I make them almost weekly.  I have used all bran, bran flakes, wheat germ and oat bran and they turn out great every time.  Also have added raspberries on occasion.  I have passed this recipe along to many people!"
310518,224,4/15/2008,5,"Wow!  This is the first Thai recipe I've ever tried.  It has a rather pungent fragrance, but is very light and refreshing.   I made it exactly as written except I used regular fish sauce because I couldn't find less-sodium version even in the Asian market.  It came out fine!  Very nice combo of flavors and textures.  We'll be eating this again! Thanks, Chef Romie.  Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2008."
604499,226,6/11/2008,4,"I give this recipe 4 stars because the combination of flavors is excellent!  However, I felt that the gelato itself was more the consistency of iced milk and lacked the creaminess of most gelato I have eaten previously.  I'm planning to play around with the gelato recipe a little bit and see if I can get the consistency to match that at my favorite little haunt."
144490,229,6/12/2008,4,"A few tweaks and this would be five stars for me. Flavor and presentation are fives, for sure! I made petite chocolate bowls using the balloon techniques as in Recipe #161209. 8 oz. chocolate yielded me 12 bowls. I searched high and low for espresso powder but couldn't find it. I knew instant coffee just wouldn't give the same flavor so I just used 2 shots of espresso instead. My gelato was lighter but the right flavor was there. I think I will substitute some cream for some the milk next in hopes of a creamier gelato. I adored the cinnamon cream, had to add a bit more cream as mine was too thick but I could have eaten a bowl of that alone. This would really be an impressive dessert for company as you can see from my photos. Advice though, do as much as you can the day before, it will make assembly much faster. Go Babes!  Zaar World Domination!"
337120,229,6/15/2008,4,"DD and I attempted this recipe for Fathers Day.  I agree with other reviews that milk alone does not create a creamy texture, so I might try with cream or half & half next time.  Also, we were not able to achieve a whipped topping effect with the small amount of heavy cream indicated and ended up using a pint (and reduced the cinnamon by half.)  We knew that the chocolate bowls were beyond our expertise so we made amaretto flavored chocolate bark with shelled pistachios which turned out great.  One thing we completely forgot when it came to serving time was the warmed nutella sauce, but none of us thought it really needed it anyway.  We loved all the various flavors.  Thanks for sharing!"
383346,229,6/22/2008,5,I loved the creaminess of this gelato.  Why buy gelato if we can do our own.  And this one is perfect.  I loved the taste of espresso and amaretto (which I added at the end when the ice cream was almost ready).  All the ingredients are made to be together.  This is pure heaven.  Thanks Babes.  Good luck!  Made for the Babes of ZWT4.
141569,229,6/24/2008,4,"I agree with wath others said, taste is great, but the consistency isn't great. I think you would need too make a custard with coffee taste and then freeze it. But as said, the taste is really good! Made for ZWT4."
987941,229,2/28/2009,5,OH MY GOSH!!!!!!! this is amazing. i will send it to everyone i know! I used whipping cream instead of milk and i halved the recipe since i have a small ice cream machine. But i will be making this alot it is my kryptonite. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!
954555,229,3/10/2009,5,"You shound'nt be allowed to post these kinds of receipes, they are sooooo fattening, but OHHHHHHHH SOOOO good!!!!!!!!!
I made these over the wkend and they were a real hit.  Everyone loved them, as one of the members said, "" THIS IS PURE HEAVEN!!!!!!!!""  Thankyou soooo much for posting this wonderful receipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UMMMMMMMMMMM"
93911,231,7/8/2010,0,"I haven't tried this recipe so I'm not rating it, but I just wanted to say that you can easily make chocolate bowls by dipping paper or silicon muffin cups in chocolate and letting them harden, then just peel off the muffin cup.  I usually dip once, let harden, then dip again."
27643,231,10/15/2002,5,"YUMMY!!! This is great! The chops are tender and juicy, the sauce is devine!! Such an easy recipe. The only changes I made were not using the pimento and I cut the peas in half. All I had to add was rolls and salad. This is definitly a KEEPER!!! Thanks RecipeNut! "
53522,232,2/10/2003,4,This recipe was very good.
2477403,232,11/1/2012,0,"Yick, yick, yick. No one in my family of five liked this recipe and we're pretty experimental when it comes to cooking. It was fast and easy to make. But we'll never make it again. Sorry"
840768,232,8/28/2013,5,"Tasty recipe. I amended it for the pressure cooker &amp; adjusted a few ingredients. Decreased the potatoes &amp; increased the mushrooms, peas &amp; worcestershire abit. There was quite abit of sauce so I will cut back the soup mixture next time (or sub yogurt for some to cut fat &amp; sodium). I also used fresh garlic while I was browning the pork chops to add more flavour. The combination of the pork with the potatoes &amp; peas mixture was a nice change &amp; enjoyed by all."
262966,232,4/18/2006,2,"Unfortunately, this turned out kind of bland for my taste.  I will try it again however, and add some tomato sauce and some crushed red pepper, as well as some additional tabasco."
58104,232,12/2/2002,5,"Quick and easy!
I also added 1/2 cup of roasted unsalted seame seeds and 2 tablespoons of honey.
Deliciously sweet!"
64154,232,1/10/2004,4,"The flavor was great. Unlike peanut brittle, it is loaded with the sunflowerseeds. 
The store only had non-salted dry roasted sunflower seeds. I felt the brittle could of been more salty. Salted seeds would probably take care of this. "
64203,232,3/2/2005,5,"I had a huge bag of dry roasted sunflower seeds in my pantry and had no idea what to do with them. I made this recipe and it was so good! My seeds were salted, so I think the flavor of this brittle was just right. It was so easy to make and it was easier to clean up after than I thought it would be too. I have more seeds and will be making this yummy treat again! Thank you!"
182809,232,10/2/2008,5,"Sharon, I both love AND hate you because of this recipe!  It turned out great and was loved by all that tasted it BUT......I too, loved it.....that's where the hate comes in.  I truly finished it up to the last drop, just what my figure needed, HAHA!  Neverthe less, this is a great item to add to your cahdy tray for the holidays."
186855,232,11/16/2008,5,"Perfect, and so quick and easy.  Wonderful flavour.  Thanks for sharing."
946146,232,12/6/2008,5,Diana #2 made this for me in the 2008 Cookie Swap.  Boy am I glad she did!  It was so good there isn't any left to share with company.  I guess I'll have to make some more :)
60124,232,9/2/2009,5,"utterly decadent! used a mix of sunflower and sesame seeds, I cant believe how good this tastes!!!"
895132,232,10/23/2010,5,"This was wonderful! I had no salted sunflower seeds and used 1/2 cup of erythritol and 2 tablespoons honey instead of the sugar, and it turned out soooo good! Thanks for posting this, I'll make it again and again!<br/>Made for Cook-A-Thon for Sharon in memory of her husband."
539686,232,12/1/2012,5,This is so easy and good. I doubled the recipe and it made quite a nice batch. I poured it out onto my Silpat sheet and clean up was no fuss. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks Sharon!
232669,232,1/2/2010,5,"Hello seemefli, I made these for the nursing home where I live - it is a Cuban facility and anything green gives them an allergy! (LOL) However, when we made these we sliced them very thin and as a previous reviewer stated, I added cilantro, red pepper flakes, a dash of nutmeg and Parmesan cheese. We also used some of the cheese as a garnish for the top. These tasted awesome, as I love spinach, but they were a great success! Thank you so much for posting, Manami :)"
398275,232,12/1/2012,5,"This was my first attempt at making brittle and I wanted to try it for three reasons.  First, I L.O.V.E. brittle.  Put whatever nuts in it you'd like, I'm going to eat it.  Second, I always have the ingredients in my pantry and fridge.  Third, and most important, it doesn't require a candy thermometer.  (They scare me!)  This recipe is the perfect combination of salty and sweet and one that will definitely be made for holiday parties.  I'll bet it would be fantastic with a light drizzle of melted semi-sweet chocolate on top.  I'll try that next time and let you know how it turns out.  Thanks for sharing, Sharon.  This is a keeper!"
522583,232,12/21/2012,0,"Simply wonderful... I only had unsalted dry roasted seeds, so I used salted butter... Great recipe for peanut allergies..."
573325,232,2/2/2013,5,"I had never made brittle before, because I was very scared of the process, but your recipe sounded so straight forward that I just had to try it. I must say, I will make this often again: It really is easy if you have time and patience. My sugar took ages to melt, but once it had melted, everything was so easy and quick and my brittle is already ready for eating. YUM! I used a chili flavoured oil to add a bit of heat and find it completements the sweetness from the sugar nicely. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this winner with us, Sharon. I cant wait to make gift baggies with this.<br/>Made and reviewed for our VIP Veggie Swap # 55 February 2013."
47892,232,2/20/2013,5,"This recipe was cut in half although the amount of butter was doubled from 1 tablespoon to 2 tablespoons. I also added 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract and most importantly used two teflon pans to melt the butter and the sugar (made for much easier clean up-NO scrubbing of pans!)  Instead of buttering a baking sheet, I lined an 8"" square Pyrex pan with parchment paper and used a small piece of parchment paper to spread and smooth the top of the brittle. This part must be done quickly before the mixture hardens but carefully so as not to burn yourself. Looking forward to all kinds of variations of this recipe! Made for SUN & SPICE Event/Veg Tag February."
26637,232,9/9/2014,5,"This was my first attempt at brittle of any kind.  I was pleased with the results and it was much easier than I expected. I like that it doesn&#039;t require a candy thermometer.   I will keep this recipe and definitely make it again. I would like to try some of the seasonings suggested by other reviewers, just for a different taste.  But this was a big hit at my sunflower themed event."
2000331850,232,7/11/2015,4,"I was delighted to discover this simple, delicious recipe. A great change from peanut butter brittle."
13483,232,5/15/2005,5,"Well these are just gems.  They are so much better than ordinary baked potatoes with sour cream in my opinion!!  If you're baking 'em anyway why not smash 'em!!  I did not have fenned seeds but I did use some celery seeds, granulated garlic, carraway seeds and parmesan cheese with the olive oil.  Just terrific.  Thank you CookingMonster."
60486,232,9/1/2008,5,"Very good. I was looking for a fennel recipe and thought this looked interesting. Super simple and easy. Made no changes or substitutions. Served with recipe #113483 and recipe #237133. I can see myself preparing these again, and trying some of the variations. Had some leftovers which reheated well: microwave until lukewarm and put in toaster oven at 450-500 for approx. 5mins."
37449,236,11/3/2008,5,I used fingerling potatoes and enjoyed them! Thanks!
1111928,236,6/14/2010,5,Very good. However I did tweek it a little since I don't really care for fennel. I drizzled the potatoes with basil flavored olive oil and topped with cheddar cheese and fresh chives out of my garden.
2503874,236,11/16/2012,4,set up beautifully once it was completely cool. I added a sprinkle of nutmeg on top and loved the added flavor.
197788,238,6/13/2007,4,This was tasty! I left out the zucchini as we don't like it. The only problem I had was I didn't have a lid for my cast iron skillet so I just put tinfoil over it.
445432,238,4/1/2007,4,"Halved the recipe and baked in 13x9 pyrex dish. Watched the batter rising in the oven and thought I had totally ruined them but the middle sank as they cooled. Tasted close to the ones I had in elementary school but I will definately cut back on the sugar. My DD ate them for breakfast : )
Edit:  Had a couple other people try them this w/e and they thought they tasted like the ones we had in elementary school."
124449,238,5/3/2007,5,"This was very good, and just enough different from the way I normally make ham salad to make it worthwhile!  I did add 2 hard boiled eggs, and used sweet pickles rather than pickle relish, just because of personal preferences.  I will definitely make this one again!  Thanks for posting!"
237951,240,8/1/2008,5,"Hurray! A new salad for DH to have for lunch sometimes!  He's happy and so am I.  He doesn't like mayo or vinegar type dressings much, so this was a wonderful discovery for us.  I might try the dressing on chicken---if I do, I'll let you know how we liked it.  Thanks."
1198780,240,3/10/2009,0,"I have tried this recipe several times and it has turned out great, and enjoyed by everyone.  I use baby spinach, so that I can skip direction # 2.  I have also added 4 green chillies and 1/2 cup chopped corriander; a dash of pepper and 1/2 cup Grana Padano parmesan cheese.  I save some of the shredded mozzarella to sprinkle on the top.  My family refers to this as ""Spinach Squares"" and it is surely a delish one!!!"
1239906,240,9/8/2014,5,"This dish is even better at room temperature or cold than it is hot.  I used frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed out) and sauteed the onion with a few cloves of minced garlic before adding them to the mix.  The squares have a pie crust taste about them after baked, similar to a quiche.  I halved the recipe and used a square baking pan, same cooking time, and they turned out perfectly."
62264,240,5/15/2008,5,Wonderful recipe! Cut 2 whole breasts from a bird into strips & proceded as directed. Doubled sauce & added about a teaspoon of fennel seed. Got pulled away from stove so added a cup of chardonnay & let simmer after step 7. Added 1/2 cup fresh chopped Italian parsley a couple of minutes before plating. Served as suggested with rigatoni. Otstanding piquant gently tempered by the balsamic vinegar. I can't wait to make with garden fresh tomatoes & basil w/o interruption this summer. Thank you Alotizzi for a real keeper!
818279,240,11/23/2009,5,Nobody can eat just one!  These were yummy delicious little morsels.  At first people thought they were small peanut butter cookies because I did the cross-hatch with a fork.  Next time I'll roll out thin and cut into squares.  DELICIOUS recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!
1900993,240,4/17/2012,5,A very light and moist cake with chocolate chips and cinnamon giving it a suitable icing that adds to the flavour of this delightful cake that I made one substitution for with pure cane sugar instead of honey which does not alter the final results of the cake
599450,240,9/13/2009,4,"We loved this. Very quick to put together and the hint of red pepper sauce was perfect! Thanks, cookiemakin'mama! Made for PAC Fall 2009."

2001346860,242,1/11/2017,0,Great looking recipe/ vegan- no animal products including honey.
1803266070,242,10/25/2014,5,Love it !   Will make this again.
2000496795,242,9/25/2015,0,"This is the best butternut squash recipe ever, but it is even better by adding a teaspoon of allspice at the same time the half and half is added. Will make again soon!"
2001028411,242,5/28/2016,5,So easy and never fails!! I add a little more stock and I have used just pumpkin before - equally as good!
136997,242,7/17/2016,5,My husband says this is a keeper. Easy to prepare and took less than an hour.
95743,242,5/23/2004,5,"Impressive and delicious if it's not cooked until it turns grey and soggy.  Looks like a lot more work than it really is.  It's easy to put together even if it may sound a bit confusing when you read the directions.  Just follow them and it will work out beautifully.  The dressing was a bit tart for our tastes but a light sprinkle of Splenda fixed that.  This will definitely be at my next dinner party as it can easily be prepared for cooking well in advance.  Thanks, s'kat."
21752,242,3/26/2007,4,"This was actually pretty good, and I don't even like okra!  I made up for that by adding another onion to the mix, and also adding some coarse-ground Hungarian paprika.  I have to put paprika in everything.  We actually had this for breakfast, with crusty rolls, lots of sweet butter and spicy matbucha (a Middle Eastern salsa).  Thanks for the cross-cultural experience, Potts!"
171084,242,6/10/2007,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this! We've fixed fried taters & onions for years but I never thought about adding okra. Served this with fried pork chops and made cream gravy from the drippings. Oh Potsie...what have you done?? :)"
2324285,242,12/11/2012,5,"This was tasty potato dish that reminded me of the potatoes my dad used to make.  He didn't use okra though, as we only just recently started getting okra in stores in Chicago.      I've gotten addicted to okra, so I think next time I might even double the amount.  I also didn't use any gravy or ketchup, as it's flavorful enough as is.  Thanks for sharing."
424680,242,6/9/2008,5,"I cut back on the amount of red pepper, but otherwise included the ingredients listed & had a very nice side dish! I particularly enjoyed it on thick slices of multigrain bread! Thanks for sharing! [Made & reviewed while on tour in Eastern Europe during the Zaar World Tour 4]"
837251,242,6/18/2008,4,"This was nice. I'm going to try it on some bread tomorrow, that seems delish to me.
The longer you leave it, the better the flavors. I followed the recipe except for the vinegar, i used balsamico. Made for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers, ZWT4"
428885,242,6/4/2007,5,"Made this for lunch, and let me tell you, if I could, I could eat this everyday. Happened to have chutney that needed using up, and had everything else on hand too. The bacon and shaved smoked salmon  coupled with the onion and cream cheese and chives just make an absolute terrific sandwich! I can see that you can also serve this on toast points and maybe the addition of cucumber too. Thanks so much English Rose! ZWT3 07'"
128473,242,5/3/2010,5,What a great sandwich.  I adored all the flavors and textures in this treat.  The mango chutney was a real nice addition.  I will be making these again often.  Thanks for sharing :)
286566,242,10/19/2013,5,"One of the best open sandwiches I have had just loved the whole lot though would like to try it toasting the bread otherwise would not make any changes whatsoever thank you English_Rose, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
622371,242,11/8/2007,4,"Originally this recipe contained a partial list of the directions, but after reviewing my email to Diane, she revised them and I retried this...It was ""FEN""tastic!!  Thank you sooo much for aditing it...it turned out wonderful!!"
1658850,243,11/2/2010,5,"Definitely addictive! I would shrink the recipe down next time. I used the biggest bowl I had and it still wasn't big enough (I used 3 cups of each cereal). I also ended up having to add more almond bark (I used candy melt that I flavored with vanilla...and when I added the vanilla it seized the melts on the first batch). In total, I used 16 oz   12 oz of candy melts, for a total of 28 oz. More wouldn't hurt, since some of the cereal pieces didn't get coated. Still addictive! I've grabbed 2 handfuls during this review! Thanks for the recipe! I could see this becoming a tradition around here!"
2002329856,243,11/12/2018,5,"These are amazing! I was super nervous about the ratio of oatmeal and flour to wet ingredients, but they were so great! I was also scared about the recipe not having eggs, which turned out to not be a problem. I did also added: a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cooking wet ingredients, a smidge more shortening, replumped my fried cranberries in the microwave, and replaced the 1/3 cup of flour with flax meal. It worked out great, because, flax meal seems to be a greedier dry ingredient when it comes to soaking up liquids. I love these cookies! So great! New favorite, thank you for sharing this recipe!!"
452940,243,7/10/2009,4,"Your right, we had to add quite a bit more apple juice, but it's a good cocktail that does taste a bit like apple brandy. Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)"

This is tasty, Boomie! I used exactly the ingredients as listed. YUMMO.

424680,245,8/31/2009,5,"Don't know if I changed the taste or texture of this cornbread, but I used a reduced-fat buttermilk as well as a no-sodium salt, but other than that the recipe was followed (well, I was generous with the half cup of corn!) & we had A GREAT TASTING CORNBREAD! Certainly a recipe I want to keep around ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Newest Zaar recipe tag]"
204024,246,11/26/2009,5,"An essential Thanksgiving ingredient for us.  We always make my mother's recipe for cornbread dressing.  This was a very fun and different type of cornbread.I had never used white corn, buttermilk, and actual corn in my cornbread. Also I loved making it in my cast iron skillet. It did not disappoint.
This is a much more dense and heavy  cornbread than we are used to.  Ours was a little underdone in the center so others should check carefully to make sure it is done.  Thank you for a fun experience, breezermom.  Made for Holiday PRMR."
573325,246,12/19/2009,4,"This is a dense and filling cornbread with a great crust and yummy sweetish taste!
It was very easy to put together, but in the end needed way longer to cook through for me (about 65 minutes). That might have been due to me using a bundt cake pan instead of a skillet, though.
I luved the addition of corn in this and found the white cornmeal to be an interesting change.
THANKS SO MUCH for sharing this lovely recipe with us, Breezer!"
17803,246,5/10/2010,5,"I had white cornmeal on hand so was glad to find this recipe.  I used a 10"" case iron skillet (1 3/4"" deep) to pour the batter in.  The pan was to small for all the batter, so I had a bit of a mess to clean up off the table, mostly the oil.   I could have used a cake pan but wanted to stick with the directions.  There was very little batter that baked over the pan in the oven.  It was crisp on the outside with a slightly sweet flavor.  I'll be making this again.  Made for *1 2 3 Hits  Its Not Easy Being Green  March 2010* (in May,  as I was late)"
1783373,246,5/16/2014,5,"Very nice cornbread.  So easy to make too.  Made it to accompany &quot;Recipe #495413&quot; and it was just wonderful.  This bread is good too toasted in the morning with a slather of butter over the top.  Found that the white cornflour made it light and airy.  I grew up on Portuguese cornbread which is normally made with white cornflour.  Though it is quite different from what I grew up on, I found this recipe to be airier and delightful.  Thank you breezermom for sharing."
1605636,246,4/28/2010,5,Love this recipe! I make it for my daughter as an after school snack and she loves it. It keeps her going until dinnertime.
60124,246,10/5/2012,5,"these were really good! did 2 large potatoes, (for 2) and used all the curry.<br/>They looked good, and tasted great. served with fish. made (late) for Aussie swap spet 2012"
369715,246,10/15/2013,3,This was good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I used beef broth instead of water. This was a meaty and beany chili that but it  was missing something for us.
4470,246,5/18/2004,5," This glaze is wonderful!  The meat was moist and after 35 minutes it was ready for the glaze then 10  more uncovered In fact it is so good that I am making another small batch of glaze and use it on the piece of tenderloin that I had left over.  I will slice the tenderloin into medalions, cover them with foil , heat for 10 min in 350F oven uncover and paint the medallions with the glaze. This will really saturate the flavor into the pork. Loved the flavor and the color is worth a picture.  Thanks Zenith for an easy tasty recipe"
129958,246,5/25/2004,4,"A very easy, moist and tender pork loin.  I had never cooked a pork loin before, now I am a big fan of it.  DH and I did not care for the flavor of the glaze, however it would be very easy to adjust the flavor to our personal tastes and will definitely try this again."
283251,246,3/20/2006,4,This was fabulous! I used the zest and juice of a whole orange and put it on the roast when I put it in the oven. The flavor sank into the meat. YUM! The only thing I would do differently next time is to add less allspice (I don't measure anything) because I added just a little too much.

321078,246,7/19/2008,5,"A little spicy for my daughter, but that's easily adjusted. Anything from Cook's Illustrated is always a winner! Thanks for posting.
P.S: I was a little freaked out by the clam juice, but the end result wasn't weird at all!"
1115621,246,4/23/2009,5,"My hard-to-please hubby said ""mmm-good!""  I will definitely put this dish in the permanent file. It has excellent flavor, even with the changes I made based on what was on hand: pre-cooked chicken andouille sausage, pre-cooked large shrimp, and orzo instead of rice.  Preparation was necessarily different as a result:  the (frozen, left-over) orzo was thawed in a separate pot with doses of chicken broth to keep it from sticking and turning to mush.  I cannot eat clams so I substituted chicken broth. The shrimp and sausage were put in together, closely followed by the processed vegies and remaining ingredients.  Because no rice was added I skipped the water and added only a shot of chicken broth to the jambalaya.  I served the stew over orzo rather than mixed in with it.  Rice would have been a more traditional taste but it was excellent anyway!"
911978,246,9/6/2011,5,This is a winner! Everybody loved it. The only change I made was using cilantro instead of parsley. I had some reservations about clam juice but it melted into the overall great flavor. Thanks for posting.
474322,246,6/21/2007,5,"We liked this rub a lot! It's best described as ""bright"", I think due to the lemon peel. I have added this to my list of things to make for gifts. I have used it on salmon, and on boneless chicken thighs. Thanks!"
107583,246,6/23/2007,5,"What a nice flavor this gives chicken!  I used it under the skin on a whole roast chicken.  Will try it on salmon soon!  (I used chopped fresh rosemary, since I have it growing in the yard.)"
33159,246,3/24/2008,5,"Delicious!!  I used this rub on boneless, skinless chicken breasts & then grilled.  I was a little skeptical about a 15 minute room temperature marinade but it was perfect.  Very lemony but not too much!!"
129958,246,10/14/2008,5,"Wow, I just noticed that I had not posted my review of this rub!  I apologize.  I have used it quite a bit on chicken and fish and it is always a hit.  I love simple rubs with ingredients that I keep on hand.  I can whip this up in a few moments and make simple chicken, etc taste special.  Thanks Cookin Mommy!"
1072593,246,7/14/2012,5,"I learned how to cook at my mom's side.  I was the only 3rd grader I knew who could accurately identify by smell any given herb.  Okay, I was the ONLY 3rd grader ANYBODY knew to accurately do that.  Great on chicken."

We loved this omelet,Peter!!
It was so simple to put together and I love how you can pour it in the pan and walkaway till its cooked!No fiddling, awesome!I did use green onions in place of the chives but I think your recipe can be altered to ones taste very easily.
Thanks so much for the recipe."
278118,246,12/2/2008,5,A very tasty breakfast!  I did take a picture but Lorrie's picture is MUCH better than mine.  My omelette fell apart a little when removing it from the pan I made it in.  I love this recipe as it is so versatile!  Next time I will make this in the traditional flipping over omelette style that I like so much.  Made for the December NZ/Aussie recipe swap.
133174,246,12/7/2008,5,"This reminded me more of a frittata than an omelet.  It is very easy to prepare and lends itself to many variations.  I loved that it required minimal tending to while cooking.  While writing the review, I realized that I had left off the cheese.  I do think that some Canadian bacon would be delicious with this."
329769,246,8/7/2009,5,*Reviewed for Aussie NZ Forum Recipe Swap August 2009* This was so easy to make and very filling. More like a frittata in that it contained the potato and wasn't flipped. I think mine cooked a little quicker but perhaps due to the pan size. I had worried about the potato cooking....but it was perfect. Thanks Peter- I really enjoyed the omelette. Photo also to be posted
37449,246,11/3/2009,5,my husband and I both enjoyed this yummy omelette! I did saute the potato and mushrooms before putting on top of the omelette. Thanks Peter! Made for the Australian Recipes Swap-Nov. 2009.
593927,246,3/7/2010,5,This was delicious. I did have to sub haloumi cheese for the cheddar and though they are nothing alike it was wonderful. I made this in my cast iron frying pan with a little canola oil. I will make this again with cheddar. Made for RECIPE SWAP #38 - March 2010 - Group 2 - Iced Vo Vo's.
11297,246,4/4/2010,5,"Very easy to make and no fiddling as someone else said :)  Made as listed this time but think other ingredients such as red pepper, spring onions and even ham could also be used or added.  Thanks for a such a versatile recipe. :)"
339260,246,5/10/2011,5,"Wonderful omelet recipe.  I used Egg Beaters egg substitute.  I also ""baked"" the potato in the microwave, sliced and fried it.  I sauteed the mushroom as well before topping the omelet.  I foldedthe omelet over to give it more of an omelet shape.  This omelet had the perfect combination of flavors.  I can't wait to make it again.  Made for May 2011 Aus/NZ Swap and Honor thy Mother - and be Gluten-Free, too! Tag Game."
286566,246,11/9/2011,5,"A very filling and satisfying breakfast, thank you Peter J, made for Aussie/Kiwi recipe wap, November 2011."
482376,246,12/12/2011,5,"Excellent omelette! I omitted the potato since I am doing a no-carb week. I can't wait to try it with the potato! Also, I didn't have mushrooms so I subbed in onions. I really like the method and think you could use the same method and change up the ingredients very easily. Thank you for a great breakfast! Made for the Aussie/NZ Swap and the PARTY event."
582561,246,2/4/2012,5,A delicious and substantial way to start they day.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap Feb 2012.
498271,246,5/1/2012,5,"This is a hearty and tasty omelette!  Loved the potato and the fact that it was grated instead of in cubes.  Left out the chives, otherwise made as directed and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
780172,246,8/23/2012,5,"This is a very good omelet, I enjoyed the addition of mushrooms and tomatoes. I like when potatoes are added to omelets, it is like a full meal then. I can not have cheese so mine was made minus cheese and it still was very nice."
128473,246,11/26/2012,5,"Frittata or Omelette by whichever name is delicious.  Quick and easy to make, filling and satisfying, great flavors and wonderful texture.  Made exactly as written, wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing."
239758,246,5/10/2014,5,"What a great omelet. I used a leftover baked potato, half of a largish tomato and 4 small mushrooms. The light spray of cooking oil didn&#039;t really do the job on my worn-out non-stick pan, which is why the pic looks like I had to dig the omelet out of the pan. After that I did what any upstanding Nebraska girl would do to an omelet with cheese -- I added some ketchup. Yum, yum! Thanks for posting."
403396,246,6/28/2007,5,"Very, very good!  Saved us a bit of money, too, as my son is quite fond of L&L's chicken katsu.  I made it exactly as described and put it in a styrofoam takeout box before nonchalantly tossing it on the table.  He was definitely fooled and only looked suspicious when he realized I hadn't left the house!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  It is definitely staying in my permanent file."
92886,246,8/9/2007,3,"Pretty good.  I found the sauce too sweet for my tastes, but if I cut back on the ketchup and sugar I think I would like it even more.  The chicken turned out nice and lightly crispy.  Made me think of schnitzel."
456455,246,11/14/2007,4,"Husband says this is a keeper! Quick, easy and tasy too."
375776,246,3/12/2009,5,"Yummy!My son,who is very picky,loved this.He loves crumbed chicken and I was very surprised when he liked the Katsu sauce.Will be making this again,thank you!Additional note,I have found it's easy to freeze in ice cube trays and then transfer them to a container."
1327837,246,2/18/2010,5,made this for my wife and what a treat. i am a truck driver and stumbled across l.l. close to one of my stops was very pleased with the texture and taste told my wife she needs to taste this chicken stuff i had found started looking aroundand found this what a great recipe if nbot as good as L.L. better all my kids now hve it in there favorite box iron woman i woulk hiss you for this thanks    papa bob
1568184,246,3/3/2010,5,I love this recipe!  Its really easy to make and the Panko makes the chicken taste so crunchy and crispy!  Goes great paired with Hawaiian Macaroni Salad
349461,246,1/24/2011,5,"I made this recipe in Wisconsin on a day that the temperature outside was in the single digits, and it brought back memories of eating 'plate lunch' on Oahu when I was in the Navy. I loved this recipe, and it tasted just like I remember. I didn't have any chicken breasts, but I used pork instead, and it was delicious."
1024930,246,6/18/2011,5,"Ok, so this recipe (for me) get the 5 stars JUST for the sauce. We had L&L for dinner the other day, and my boyfried who is NOTORIOUSLY BAD at screwing up directions, orderd REGULAR portions for me AND my 6 yr old daughter, and only got 1 thing of sauce!!!  needless to say, my daughter and i could have SPLIT just ONE of the generouse portions and had leftovers... so I had A LOT of leftovers!  BUT NO SUACE!!!  i googled ' L&L Katsu sauce recipe""  and this came up. I made it, and its tastes pretty much SPOT ON to L&L!!!!  major props!!!"
1975031,246,8/8/2011,5,AWESOME. Trying brown sugar instead of granulated next time to see if it makes a difference in taste. This recipe is right on the money though! Try it!
2780901,246,4/17/2013,5,Awesome recipe.  Made it for dinner and everyone loved it.
921361,246,10/3/2014,0,Tasted great and was super easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!
2001039822,246,6/6/2016,5,"Very simple recipe, easy to follow. Only trouble I had was the process of making the sauce. Other than that everything was perfect! I also went and used macaroni salad as a side!"
2001615771,246,7/6/2017,5,"Thanks so much for this recipe! My son and I have been going to Hawaii for last few years but not this year. He's addicted to L&amp;L Hawaiian BBQ's Chicken Katsu. We're from Michigan and don't have them here. Went out West this year and he managed to find an L&amp;L in Portland, OR, 30 miles out of our way in 100&deg; heat. Made this tonight and he was over the moon! Used organic chicken breasts, pounced down and soaked in buttermilk to tenderize. The guy from the Portland L&amp;L mentioned using a 1/2 brown/white sugar mixture, which kept sauce from being too sweet. Only issue I had was some of the coating was coming off on last batch. I used jumbo eggs, which is what I had on hand, so batter was a little thin. Served with scoop of jasmine rice and Mac salad I had leftover from 4th of July party."
160974,246,10/3/2007,5,"I couldn't resist even though it is fall! I was able to find pretty good nectarines so it was fine. This is so intensely fruity and refreshing. I love the fresh fruit chunks. Delicious with/without Cool Whip. I used four dessert glasses and the rest fit (to the top) of a 9 inch square pan. Thanks Tammi, for another great recipe.

1024982,246,4/22/2009,5,Sounds like the real thing!
2001454217,246,7/12/2018,4,Salad was awesome. I also added parsley for freshness. great meal added to my nutrition plan.
200862,246,3/2/2011,3,"MADE FOR PAC, March 2011. Dear AskCy, this recipe is very hard for me to review. As my adopted cook, I'd love to give you 5 stars for every recipe!! This one made it to ""good"" (3 stars). It is perfectly nice, very easy, real comfort food, but the taste is very ordinary. Normally I would have added lots of herbs and maybe chillies, but I wanted us to taste your recipe as you wrote it. AskCy, maybe my biggest problem is with your cooking method, and I wonder if you'd consider editing your recipe? The litre of beef stock would have been FAR too much: I added 1 cup! (250 ml). (Did you make a mistake with that litre?) In the photos you can hopefully see 250 ml was enough, as the veggies also shed some liquid. I also have a problem with your cooking times. No ways could I cook this dish, after adding the peas, ""for a good hour""!! I added the peas once the baby potatoes was almost tender, and it took literally minutes for the peas and potatoes to be perfect after that, and I removed it from the heat. A small point, but maybe worth mentioning for the 5-star recipes you are still going to post for us: list your ingredients in the order in which they will be used, i.e. oil first. The title: it puzzled me a little (this is not a criticism!) as we would never call a mince dish a ""stew"". One associates a stew with chunks of meat. But never mind that. Also, this dish, with rice and sides, will feed at least 4 - 6 hungry people! Very economical in these times. Thank you, AskCy, and please post more of your recipes!"
166642,246,11/10/2007,5,"These are outstanding! We just loved them - great flavor and easy to make! I did serve them with chicken, just not barbecue, but they were delicious. No leftovers! Thanks!"
430471,246,12/10/2007,5,So good and easy the only thing I thought was missing was some cheese. Maybe next time I'll add some. Served with chilli. YUMMY!
527607,246,2/2/2008,5,"Outstanding.  I was non traditional and served them with sour cream (low fat) lol

easy and delicious, a great lunch"
337963,246,4/28/2008,4,"What a fun recipe!  I served them with sticky fingers and a tomato salad.  We weren't quite sure how to serve them, so I topped mine with sour cream and more green onion, and for hubby I served drizzled with a bit of molasses instead.  The best thing about this recipe is that you can serve a ""bread"" side with dinner that's made from scratch and is super quick.  Thanks for posting Paula, made for PAC.  Please see my rating system as I rate tougher than most."
837152,246,5/15/2008,5,Had along with fried chicken and we woofed them down in no time!  We put butter on ours.
128473,246,4/19/2010,5,"Another tasty treat from Paula.  Wow, were these good.  I had never tried them before, so wasn't sure what to expect.  A lovely light tasting pancake with an awesome flavor.  These were incredible served plain with recipe #283235 and steamed rice.  They really were excellent, they sopped up the tasty gravy beautifully, even my picky dh had two.  Into my keeper box this goes, can't wait to try it with BBQ chicken and crispy pork.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Made for Pac 2010 :)"
174096,246,4/25/2010,5,"Delicious!  We loved how it got a nice crispy outside, with a good flavor, and a light texture.  I drizzled ours with honey just before serving.  It made a great brunch with Recipe #310625.  Thanks for sharing!"
339260,246,2/18/2011,5,"I think this makes a delicious side to almost any meal.  These hoecakes were easy to whip up and cook on the griddle.  They were light and delicious.  I ate some with just butter and some with honey...both were yummy!  The green onion was a nice touch.  I think they would be really good with some green chiles also.  Thanks for another great recipe, PaulaG.  Made for Best of 2010 Cookbooks Tag Game."
1531249,246,7/20/2012,4,"These tasted delicious.  However, I had some difficulty flipping them because they were so fragile.  I finally switched from my cast iron skillet to a nonstick pan, with better results."
781390,246,4/22/2008,5,"Very good, followed recipe and turned out delicious."
39334,246,2/10/2008,5,"These were so good!!! We planned on making bone-in breasts, but after realizing all I had was boneless breasts, I decided to use this recipe. And I am so glad I did! The only thing I did differently was to put the chicken on a rack on a cookie sheet to keep the bottoms from getting soggy. But the cornflakes made for a crispy coating and the seasoning was delicious!!! Thanks for posting such a yummy, delicious recipe...I can't wait to try it with tenders for chicken strips...yum!"
610843,246,1/10/2008,5,"My mom found this recipe in a magazine many years ago and it was passed on to me when I got married. This is one of my families most favorite meals. I usually don't have olives but the taste is still great. I have also used Jiffy corn muffin mix for the crust. It is a sweeter crust than I prefer, but makes this recipe a quick fix dinner. Fat-free refried beans help cut down on calories and does not affect the taste. I also use turkey burger instead of ground beef."
36128,246,1/7/2003,5,"I am so grateful for this recipe.  It is hard getting my family to love eggplant as I do, so I wanted to try this one, cuz it sounded so yummy!  This was an over all winner with everyone here.  My son loved it, and my hubby too!  I think he went backe for 4ths.  LOL  I made it with shredded mozza since I didnt have a block of cheese to cut!  THanks for a great side dish!!!"
59064,246,1/24/2003,5,"Yum! something this quick should not taste so good and be so healthy. Even people who don't like tofu should like this one and it is a great way of using nutritional yeast.
I made a few minor changes using grapeseed oil, ketjap manis, lime juice and wholegrain mustard because that's what I had in the house. It's a great recipe for those days when you don't want to cook at all and want something light but substantial."
46545,247,2/26/2003,5,"Wonderful sauce for pasta, veggies, rice, maybe even a baked potato!  I used 1/2 C water and dissolved 1 large veg bouillon cube in it for the vegetable stock.  This gives it even more flavor.  Also, I used a little less oil to save a few fat calories.   "
140331,249,4/7/2005,5,Where has this recipe been all my life?  It's too good to pass up.  I had it on noodles and then again on rice and then again over rice and veggies.  Love it.Thanks!
277855,249,12/27/2005,5,"I loved this and so did the non-vegetarians I served it to.
"
163214,249,4/13/2006,5,My whole family loved this sauce. I heated it and served it over rotini pasta. I will definitely make this again. Thanks! 
91724,249,8/11/2007,5,"This is so good and it's good on so many things, as others have mentioned. I heated it and served it over angel hair pasta and vegetables and it's the kind of thing you can't stop eating. My one year old grandson loved it.  Doesn't matter if you don't like tofu; it doesn't taste like tofu."
85730,249,2/10/2011,5,"This was different from other pasta sauces I've had or made, but it was tasty. No one will know there's tofu in it unless you tell them, and it's got a whole lot more protein than your average pasta sauce. We enjoyed it over Barilla Plus penne and steamed broccoli."
68460,249,3/22/2003,5,"Another good recipe!  I made this exactly as written using 1 pound of white button mushrooms and 1/2 pound baby portobellos.  This soup has a rich, earthy flavor and smells wonderful while it's cooking.  It was the perfect meal for us on the cold, rainy day we were having.  I served it with Caesar salad and hot rolls.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe, it's going into my permanent recipe file!"
65056,249,11/20/2003,5,"I made this as part of the Comfort Food Cook-a-thon and I'm so glad I did!  My boyfriend decided this is his new favorite soup (and I make a lot of soups) and ate a bowl of it with breakfast, lunch and dinner until it was gone.  I made it a week (or more) ago and he's been bothering me every day to make more!  I dodn't have any bay leaves, so I used some thyme and other spices to taste.  I used a mix of white button and crimini (these are the same thing as baby portobello, by the way, for those who don't know).  I also used one small-medium unpeeled russet potato.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  This tastes completely gormet and really isn't much work, less slicing all the mushrooms.  I know I'll be making this again (by BF demands it!)  Thanks so much for posting."
80353,251,1/3/2004,5,"Truly delicious and so easy to make!  I used a combination of button mushrooms and oyster mushrooms (no portobella here today) and the flavour was outstanding.  Soothing, satisfying, and the barley added just the right touch of toothsomeness.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that goes in the keeper file!"
123640,251,3/7/2004,5,"This recipe was very well received at our house.  I thought it was a good, tasty soup, but my husband and a visiting friend practically inhaled it, and hubby has been demanding it ever since.  I made the recipe as-is the first time, and added 1/2 tsp thyme after that."
116315,252,5/21/2004,5,"Like the other reviews, a very good soup, it smelt so delicious and was too.  I added about 2 tbsp. of sour cream to each bowl full and this was what I was missing in my personal taste."
37779,252,12/20/2004,5,This is a very soul-soothing delicious soup. We are just starting to get bitter cold weather here and I am so glad I had this soup to enjoy. I used a combo of baby bellas and button mushrooms. I made no alterations and the flavor and smell were excellent. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will make again.
246898,256,10/2/2005,5,My mother says this is the best mushroom barley soup she has ever had. I put some in the freezer to save and she took it back out to serve to company. I added some additional barley and I simmered the soup for an hour. Will be making this often.
108902,256,10/30/2005,5,"Wow. This is sooo amazing. It took me a little longer than I expected with all the chopping of vegetables, but it was worth it. I didn't have barley, so I used Instant Brown Rice. I'll be making this often. Thanks!"
223325,261,11/3/2005,4,"A very tasty and enjoyable dish, but I think you might consider it more of a stew than a soup. Either way it was delicious!!"
278207,261,1/1/2006,5,"This soup reminded me of the traditional mushroom soup my family made every Christmas Eve, only with more butter and minus the carrots and potato.  It took me forever to cut up all the veggies because I'm not a good cook.  Regardless, this soup turned out delicious.  I still can't believe I made something so good."
39835,261,2/13/2006,4,Very good soup which we enjoyed with popoovers. Instead of the chicken broth I used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth--next time I think I'll use all vegetable broth to make it a vegetarian soup. Thanks for sharing!
62043,261,10/10/2006,5,"This was an extremely delicious barley soup. The addition of portobella mushrooms added a meaty, woodsy taste that was very appealing. I will definately make this again. Thanks!"
362983,261,1/2/2007,4,"Great soup. Very easy to make and it was hearty and delicious. I added lots of herbs to the soup, though I would probably add some seasonings when sauteeing the vegetables to add some more flavour to them in the soup since they seemed a little bland to me with just butter. Still, very yummy!"
208125,261,11/1/2007,5,"Very delicious, the mushroom flavour wasn't drowned out by the other ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and we thought that it didn't really need the potato but the soup would be great either way."
203111,261,11/4/2007,3,"This is one of those soups that shouldn't be served until the next day, IMO.  It was ok the first day but I had my doubts about making it again because it takes so long to cut up all the vegs.  But I decided it was all well worth it when I had a bowl the next day. Yum! I did add about 1/4 cup of cream to it."
149075,261,5/20/2009,5,"a lovely, nourishing soup. I only used half the butter, and just a little oil to saute the veggies. I added a touch of sherry towards the end to enhance the nutty flavor of  the different mushrooms I used. The family loved this soup."
206213,261,6/24/2009,4,"I made this soup yesterday, with adjusted menu for 4 people - DH dislikes too much barley :>( doesn't know what's good for him!
I have to say I wasn't overly impressed with the initial flavour, so added some good frozen(then defrosted) chicken stock to it. Today I reheated it and felt the flavour had much improved. I really enjoyed it -- DH said- less barley and more potato -- I disagree as I love barley. I don't know that it will be a regular on  our soup menu, but I'll will have it again - for me!!! Thank you BoxO'Wine because I love soup and it's always  good to have a go at something different from the norm :>)"
234075,261,1/3/2010,5,"Very good. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added about a tsp dried thyme, little bit of rosemary, and finished it with a generous dollop of chardonnay. The next day, the flavor had become rich and full bodied. Thanks for posting. I will make this again!"
545970,261,1/23/2011,3,"I liked this and it was better the 2nd day.  I'm only giving 3 stars because no one else in the family would eat it, even the mushroom lovers.  If I were to make this again, I would chop all the mushrooms (instead of the slicing) and double the barley."
744367,261,1/25/2011,0,"This soup was delicious. i only made a couple changes.  I used one can of beef broth, one can of chicken broth and 2 cans of vegetable broth. I also used salted butter since thats what i had on hand. I sliced some shitake and baby portebellos too to add to the mix, they were a delicious addition.  I am giving it 5 stars and would give it more if i could because it was my 11 and 7 year old that ate ALL of the soup!  I had a bowl before i napped before my 3rd shift job, and when i awoke, looking forward to bringing a bowl to work with me, it was GONE!!  DH told me that they each had 2 helpings for dinner, and the kids begged for more later till they finished it!  Needless to say, im on my way to the store after writing this review, to get some more mushrooms to make a double recipe for tonights dinner :)  oh, let me add that i also left out the potato"
1991003,261,4/5/2012,5,I have put this soup into my new healthy menu rotation.  It is delicious.  I used beef broth cubes and cut the amount by 50% to help reduce the sodium level.  Thank you for sharing this healthful recipe!
53156,261,3/21/2003,5,"This cake was easy and really yummy! I do a lot of ""high end"" baking normally. Genoise, etc. But this time I needed a quick cake and this fits the bill. Wonderfully moist and flavorful."
50711,261,6/4/2006,3,"My DH is a chocoholic so this recipe sounded right up his alley.  While it was very easy to make, and it was moist and tasted ok, I didn't think it had much chocolate flavor.  If I make again I will add more melted chocolate and see if that helps.  Thanks for posting this Elaine."
198154,262,7/16/2014,5,"I&#039;m typically not a fan of the texture of buttermilk cakes. But I had buttermilk that I needed to use up and I needed to make a cake for my in laws anniversary.  The other thing that made me a little hesitant was the nutmeg. A lot of recipes add cinnamon to their chocolate cake and I don&#039;t care for it.  This cake however, had good texture and great flavor! The only thing I would suggest is to check your cake. Mine was finished with more than five minutes left on the timer.   I topped this with a chocolate fudge buttercream frosting. Yum!"
55380,266,7/5/2004,4,"Thanks, Shelly! The fridge died and I was left with all the meat thawed, including a brisket, and none of the condiments I usually use. This saved the brisket! I've never used Liquid Smoke for this cut before, although I had some in the cabinet for summer sausage. I'd wondered when it made such a small amount but trusted your note in the recipe and you're right! I ended up marinading it for almost 24 hrs and then cooked it in the crockpot. It was very flavorful - tangy and smoky - and I have a feeling the leftovers would have been even moreso...if there had been any! ;o) I'm not sure it will replace our main recipe, but we now have the perfect backup. A definite 4.5 stars!"
6357,266,9/1/2004,5,This was incredibly truly so yummy that my dad has requested me to make it every alternate weekend for dessert!! Truly a keeper:) Thank you very much for sharing! 
141042,266,9/7/2004,5,"Just delicious fudgy fudge.  This was enjoyed by young and old alike.  I added chopped nuts and an additional drop of orange extract, as my grated orange zest fell a little short of the two teaspoons the recipe calls for.  I'm going to try the mint too!  Thank you for posting!"
130970,266,11/21/2004,5,"This recipe is so simple and good. I made 2 batches today, one with orange zest and Cointreau, the other one with Chambord, and instead of pecan (the only kind of nut I don't like too much), I added chopped walnut and almond. Turns out very well. This will definitely be one item in my xmas gifts."
98063,266,2/18/2005,5,"I've made this about five times already and keep forgetting to review it. It is yummy and beautifully simple to make. I never used the pecans, but did add a tsp of orange extract. I'll have to try the other variations some time, but I just keep making this one because it is so good."
138861,266,3/19/2005,5,"YUM!!! This was so good that we ate almost the whole batch in one night. I did have a bit of trouble initially trying to get the chocolate and condensed milk to melt and smoothen but I think it was because I had the double boiler on too high of a temperature. Oh well, the taste was still the best, and it was so simple to put it together. I will definately be making this again."
206722,270,6/3/2005,5,"This was wonderful, and SO easy to make. It came out beautifully....put a smile on all our faces!"
39194,270,12/26/2005,5,"I was very glad I tried this fudge!  It was quite easy to make, and although I did use orange extract (3 drops), it came out wonderful.  I am going to experiment with other flavors as well.  Thank you Marg! :)"
55380,270,12/27/2005,5,"This was simple enough that my 10 yr old could do it on her own, but definitely good enough to give for gifts. The first time we used grated orange peel (the kind in a jar in the spice aisle) and the orange flavor was barely discernable. The next time we tried fresh orange zest and it was better. I have some orange extract and we'll try adding a dash of that next time, since we're all huge chocolate-orange fiends and like the stronger flavor combo. Orange taste or not, this is a simple but very good fudge, very smooth and not overly sweet (we used a combination of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips). We haven't tried the pecans yet but I'm sure one of these times we'll toss them in as well. Thanks so much for posting! "
280238,270,1/2/2006,5,"I made two different fudge recipes for Christmas this year.  The first go-round  the fudge was made from scratch and was tedious to make. My family loved it and It turned out nice and creamy.  Then I made this recipe.  Wow..my family LOVED it and our friends begged for more. They raved about how the fudge just melted in your mouth with rich chocolaty flavor - then the orange kicked in! Sort of a one-two punch of tasty delight! I made lots of it for Christmas gifts and I cut it into big hunks, wrapped it in plastic wrap, put a beautiful ribbon around it and included a clear plastic knife for cutting off your own pieces.  It was fudge to be proud of.  From now on, this is the fudge I'll be making for gift giving.  Quick and easy. What could be better?  Oh yeah...don't forget the walnuts!  Yum!  Thanks Marg for submitting this wonderful recipe."
14112,270,1/4/2006,5,"This fudge is delicious!  I have never made fudge before.  I've always been too scared to try.  This seemed easy enough, and it was!  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for a great recipe."
102058,270,2/1/2006,5,"I made this without the nuts too... Wonderful ! Smooth, and deceptive... it sets very solid, so I was a bit worried, but cuts easily with a decent amount of pressure (I didn't break my hand doing it) and it was still melt in your mouth soft once you took a piece or ..um... 4 !!! Our family aren't fans of orange peel so I used two teaspoons of orange essence... could have been a bit stronger for our taste at least 'cos the orange was only a vague after-taste of orange instead of a more predominant flavour (which DH really likes) I'm itching to make this with the peppermint in it and might even try a mix with some Tia Maria one time or Bailies ?... this will be my recipe of choice when DD's school asks for bake sale things for fundraising since it's just embarrasingly easy and fast to make and you just know that kids will leave telling you that they need something until the evening before... Now, no stress, I will have this recipe on hand to whip up and save the day :) Please see my rating system, an excellently deserved 5 stars! Thanks !
UPDATE: I've made this 4 times recently and I added 3 Tablespoons of peppermint essence to get the strength that's perfect for us. Mint is the prefered flavour here so far... this stuff practically walks off the plate when you have guests, so I'll be making this often in the future. Thanks !"
202661,270,2/2/2006,5,"My fudge of choice.  I have made this recipe dozens of times over the past ten years.  Everyone is correct that it disappears.  I bring the ingredients to work and and make in my microwave I have there.  It amazes everyone to see it made.  For gifts I cut it into squares and roll those into truffle balls then roll in or sprinkle with cocoa powder.  It makes a very elegant gift that way. I use 3 - 4 drops of Orange Oil by Nature's Flavors when I am making orange fudge, but Nature's Flavors has so many wonderful oil concentrates the possibilities are endless.  Please try this fudge.  You'll never make another."
234222,270,2/2/2006,5,Wow - this fudge is wonderful!  What could be better than an easy recipe with great results?!  I used pure orange extract instead of the orange zest and it turned out great!  Thanks for sharing - will make again!
144431,271,4/25/2006,5,"Wonderful and so easy!  I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of orange zest and added about 1 teaspoon of Triple Sec.  After chilling, I rolled into truffles and then in cocoa powder.  Served on a bed of mini chocolate chips and long, thin orange zest shavings, they were a hit!  I can't wait to try them with other flavors; thank you!"
303646,271,5/9/2006,5,I wouldn't really describe the end product of this recipe as fudge but everyone who tried it couldn't get enough of it. My friend won't let me make anymore bcos she's addicted to these and i'm spoiling her diet; Lol! I hadn't got any pecans so i omitted them and added 1/2 teaspoon of chilli powder (sounds weird but it honestly tastes good). Thanks for this fabulous recipe!
213540,271,9/29/2006,5,Awesome and soooooo easy! My 6 and 8 year old boys love to help make this and eat it too:) So far we like the peppermint extract the best. Four drops gave it a subtle peppermint flavor and 7 drops gave it a little more distinct flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!
198059,271,10/22/2006,5,This is so delicious it's going to be my xmas gift of choice. 
361186,271,10/27/2006,4,This was so quick and easy and the texture is perfect - so smooth. It cuts beautifully too. I just have to work on getting the flavor to how I like it. I think the idea of half milk-chocolate half semi-sweet is a good one. I tried peppermint instead of the orange flavor so that might have been part of the problem. The dark chocolate might have been a better compliment to the orange flavor.
751189,271,4/2/2009,5,Love this!!
158087,271,10/29/2006,5,It's amazing what a few ingredients can produce.  I used 2 c bittersweet and 1/2 c semi-sweet and skipped the pecans.  I will use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!
152393,271,12/2/2006,4,"This is an easy, delicious recipe.  I had 3 cups of chocolate chips left so I  microwaved those with low-fat condensed milk at 30 second intervals until melted, then added 3 teaspoons of orange extract with the rest of the ingredients   After pouring into a pan, I grated a little extra orange peel on top.  This is a very good recipe for anyone that enjoys the taste of chocolate and orange together it makes a perfect addition to my holiday gift baskets!  Thanks Marg for this great recipe."
248414,271,12/23/2006,5,This is a real star of a recipe! Incredibly easy and everyone loves it!  I also made it without the nuts and grated extra  orange zest on top.
473347,271,4/30/2007,5,"This was my first try at making fudge and it couldn't have been easier. I used the microwave and added 2 teaspoons orange extract. I omitted the pecans, this is a keeper!"
106867,271,5/18/2007,3,"This was good, but the texture is different than typical fudge.  This is absolutely smooth, without the grainyness I associate with fudge.  I left out the orange zest and just left it chocolate and nuts. Next time I will use a blend of milk and dark chocolate."
110433,271,11/2/2007,5,"This is amazing! I brought half a batch in to work yesterday, and it was gone in minutes! I brought the other half today and it disappeared! My mother, who is very picky, loved it, and I'm making two batches for a friend's sweet trays for their wedding. I used orange flavour instead of zest. I'm going to try Cointreau in the next batch. Our cans are 12oz, so I used 2 cups and a handfull of chips and it worked beautifully. Melted in a glass measuring cup in the microwave. Thanks!

Update:  I just made a batch of these with zest, and the orange flavour really comes through.  I'm finding the two cups and a handfull too little though.  I'm going to bring it up to 2 1/2 cups of chips with our 10oz can so they don't get so soft if you leave them out for a bit.  Still taste amazing."
395940,271,11/18/2007,3,"Creamy, but way too sweet. Easy one to make!"
360471,272,11/25/2007,5,"I absolutely love how easy this is to make and it's really creamy and rich. I'm not crazy about orange and chocolate so I substituted about 3tsp of Peppermint extract (I say ""about"" because I was making a double batch and 6 tsp was almost the whole bottle of extract so I just dumped the rest in :) )Then I topped it with crushed peppermint pieces and OH MY GOSH!!! it was so good. I had to keep hubby and daughter off of it since I was making it as gifts..I let them have SOME, I'm not that mean. I was trying this out because I was wanting something that was easy but looked impressive and tatsed great to make for teachers and I definitely found it! This is going in my permanent file."
381180,272,12/5/2007,5,Quick and easy ~ and delicious!  I made a 2-layer chocolate and peanut butter fudge ~ pairing this fudge (used 1 tsp vanila extract instead of the orange zest) with Recipe #115656.
506722,272,12/8/2007,5,"Just made this plain for a first run.  Creamy, and yummy.  So easy.  Next time I'll add nuts, and will like it even better.  Thank you, I told Mom I'd do fudge for Dad because she just had surgery.  With a baby it was going to have to happen after he was in bed.  This was so easy, I made it while he played on the floor.  He saw the chocolate chips and started to scream (Mom gave him one last time we stopped by when I was doing laundry).  He likes fudge now, too.  Lucky for him I make it whenever Dad needs a fix, and at Christmas, but not weekly.  This was so easy it could be made weekly, but then I would really gain weight.:)"
231054,273,12/10/2007,5,"What could possibly be easier -- and yet be so dang delicious???  I only add to what others have said -- what an easy fudge recipe -- and yes it DOES have feet because it truly can ""walk off the plate"".  I used the grated orange zest and added a couple drops of orange extract.  Peppermint is next!!!!  Thanks Marg for sharing this recipe with all of us."
209154,273,12/13/2007,5,"A truly decadent fudge.  This fudge held its shape nicely and had a nice, smooth texture (not gritty).  LOVE the orange.  It made it taste similar to orange sticks.  Yummie!!!  I made three different fudges (#4075 & #68659) and this was my favoriate by far.  Thanks, Marg."
189616,274,12/14/2007,5,"With how much my family enjoyed this fudge, I wish I actually had a sweet tooth. They raved over this. Was planning on orange, but everyone wanted me to make peppermint.
Super recipe!"
469903,275,12/17/2007,5,"Perfect, easy orange fudge!!  I skipped the nuts and the fudge was smooth and creamy, just wonderful. I chilled in the fridge for about an hour and then easily cut into bite-size pieces and returned them to the fridge for safe keeping - they turned out beautifully. The only trouble will be keeping them around long enough to share for Christmas... can't keep anyone out of them! Really great recipe, I plan to make the peppermint too!"
451042,276,12/21/2007,5,"This is the perfect, dark chocolately rich, dense fudge and orange combo. If you really want the orange to give a punch, I suggest adding 3 teaspoons of orange zest. Make sure your orange zest comes from an orange with thick, ripe skin.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now and found that I have to melt the chocolate chips first and then add the milk. Otherwise it gets too thick and I cannot mix it.

My husband melted the chips and I added the milk and orange peel. 

We had to work quickly once the milk went in because it does thicken. We spread it in a baking dish lined with parchment paper and let it chill for 2 hours before cutting. I love the truffles idea and am going to attempt to do that with our next batch. Thanks!"
739521,276,12/30/2009,5,Great Recipe!  Gave as gifts to several people who raved about it!  Can't believe how quick and easy this recipe was.  Thanks for posting!
226066,276,12/22/2007,5,"36 people can't be wrong!!! :) Made this without the pecans and brought to the office for the last day of work before Christmas... these were gone within minutes!! (Glad I kept a few at home!! ;) - this is easy, sweet and oh so good!!  Thanks Marg for a fudge recipe that I will be making again and again!! :)"
537188,276,12/25/2007,3,"Strangely enough, this fudge hasn't set. It does taste quite nice though but there's no way I would be able take it out of the tin - I think we're going to have to resort to eating it with spoons!"
548802,276,12/27/2007,5,I really liked the simplicity of this recipe. I doubled it and made half peppermint (4teas peppermint extract) and half with pecans. I never added any orange flavoring. It adapted well. This was a big hit at Christmas!
479694,276,1/2/2008,5,I used peppermint versus the orange.  It turned out very well especially me being the novice baker.  I could even  make it. I took it to a potluck and people raved. Next time I will use a little less peppermint then suggested in another review.  It came out a little strong
614212,277,1/7/2008,5,"VERY easy, and turned out soooo well. It's delicious. DH loves it. I made it with mint this time, but I can't wait to try it with orange, that's what we really want....and then every other possible flavour :) this is the first time I've sucessfully made fudge, and I am so happy I tried this recipe. Oh, I left out the pecans as well."
242444,278,1/8/2008,5,"So easy and yummy.  The first time I made it I used 1 bag of chocolate chips.  It was good, but not as good as when I made it again and used the full 2 1/2 cups. I also omitted the nuts.  

I have also melted the chocolate and condensed milk together then split the batch in half and made half peppermint and half orange.  It's good both ways."
354628,278,2/3/2008,5,"This is great. This is actually the one thing my brother in law requested I make as soon as he returned from Iraq.
I also top it with an orange glaze.  I mix powdered sugar, and milk, with food coloring and orange extract. It makes it colorful, and adds a little something extra."
544026,278,2/19/2008,4,"I made this for a chocolate party at work and both DH and I liked them (I made both the orange and the peppermint variety). I used zest from freshly picked oranges, yet we barely could detect the orange flavor. I used a 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract, and also had difficulty in identifying the flavor....so I added another 1/2 tsp. It seemed to work better. With the orange zest, I added chopped pecans, and nothing to the peppermint variety. We both liked the orange flavor better, albeit faint. It may be the nuts that drew us to that decision. All in all, it was a very good recipe, but not out of this world. This is an easy recipe to follow and to make. Thanks for posting, Marg."
13483,278,4/27/2008,5,Just a very easy yet excellent fudge to make.  I used the pepermint extract  (about a teaspoon) and it was great.  Love easy and good stuff like this.  Thanks for the post.
774187,278,6/28/2008,5,"WONDERFUL fudge! What a wonderful marriage of flavors! I did add an extra teaspoon of freshly grated zest, left out the nuts and used milk chocolate chips rather than the semi sweet. Made it for a dinner party, and it was a HUGE hit! I would recommend refrigerating over night or at least eight hours. I did mine for four and they were still slightly gooey. But still scrumptious! And the flavor of the orage did seem to come out more the next day. I don't know why. But Yummy!"
97780,278,12/14/2008,3,This gets credit for being easy but just didn't do much for me.  Maybe using milk chocolate chips would have made it better.  I hoped the sweet milk would sweeten up the chocolate but it really didn't and then the orange seemed to make the judge bitter.  I love orange chocolate but I won't be making this again.
944660,278,12/16/2008,1,"WORST fudge recipe I have ever had the misfortune of making! It gets one star from me because it apparently worked for other people. This garbage did not set properly, even after over 15 hours. Do NOT make this recipe unless you are willing to risk the colossal waste of time and money."
1055399,278,12/23/2008,5,"I LOVE this fudge recipe!! It is very versatile. I made it once with only the choc. chips, condensed milk and 1/2 tsp of orange extract, once with the choc. chips, cond. milk, and 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and crushed candycane on top, and once with choc. chips, cond. milk, and walnuts. I used Nestle choc. chips and Borden Sweetened Condensed Milk and it set perfectly. It was solid, yet creamy. What an easy, yet delicious recipe!!!!"
297303,278,2/23/2009,3,"although, this candy had a great orange flavor, we didn't care for this.  It's not what I consider fudge. My husband thought it was more on the chewy side.  I also don't care to keep my fudges refrigerated.  When I took it out of the refrigerator, the chocolate melted on our fingers.  Sorry, I was really hoping to love this, seeing how it is so easy."
384088,278,3/30/2009,5,I made this for the holidays and it was a big hit! This has now been added to my regular baking goodies. :-)
274467,278,12/18/2009,5,"Fantastic!  Super easy, too.  I used 2 tsp. orange extract instead of the orange zest, and it was perfect.  I made one batch without nuts and used chopped walnuts for the other, since it was what I had on hand.  Today, I am going to try and make a mint variation.  Thanks for the recipe, Marg!"
228229,278,12/19/2009,5,"Very, very, very good!"
592157,278,8/19/2008,5,This was really very good.  I did cut back on the chilies (family preference) but it still had so much flavor.
87236,278,1/3/2010,5,"Incredible!!!  So many people raved about this fudge (which I have made twice in a week already!) and I felt a twinge of guilt about the fact that it only took about five minutes to prepare, from start to finish!!!  I have made fudge in the past which entailed a lot of time and fuss, and all I can say is that nothing compared to the ease, simplicity and taste of this recipe! Instead of using orange zest, I used 1 1/2 tsp of orange extract, and it tasted just like Chocolate Orange confectionery that can be bought in the candy section of grocery stores! (but softer)!  I placed the condensed milk and Chocolate chips in a bowl, mixed it together, then nuked it in the microwave at power level 7 for three minutes. After mixing it with a wooden spoon until it was smooth and blended, I added the extract. So easy!  This recipe will readily lend itself to experimentation. (and I WILL be experimenting!)  Maybe next time I'll use white chocolate chips with almond extract, or maybe peanut butter chips! Thank you so much for posting, Marg!"
880245,278,5/30/2010,5,"This is superb. I changed it up by using  dark chocolate,1/4 c pecans and 1/4 c chopped dried cranberries num num
kpb"
688566,279,6/3/2010,5,"Fantastic, whipped this up this morning before work.  Made in microwave as per another reviewers suggestion 3 minutes on 70% power.  Didn't even stir during this time.  Mixed together beautifully.  I used about a cup each of milk and dark chocolate and half a cup on peppermint chocolate & about 1/2 tsp peppermint essence.  Its in the fridge chilling now & the whole process took only 5 minutes.  From the taste on the spoon this is going to be great.  Is supposed to be a gift for this afternoon, hope it makes it there!"
307475,280,12/1/2010,0,"These are great for someone like me who can't have gluten! I used the peppermint extract, and they flew off the plate at a party I hosted.<br/><br/>My only thought, and this sounds a little silly perhaps: be sure you are using sweetened condensed milk and not evaporated milk, as the latter would yield terrible, wet results."
1144471,280,12/18/2010,4,"I made this just as directed and I LOVED the flavor. Not sure I am 100% fan of the consistancy...I like my fudge a little more firm. But, have decided to make another batch and cook it a little longer to see if that makes a difference."
344199,280,12/19/2010,5,This fudge tastes like a Cadbury Chocolate orange!  I added a tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp orange extract and 2 Tablespoons of butter.  Delicious!
938397,280,12/5/2011,4,I really enjoyed this fudge.  Simple. Easy.  Quick.  I used dark chocolate and walnuts. I rate 4 stars as a recipe that I would do again and share with others.  5 stars is something I'm dying to make again and add to my home cookbook.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is becuase I like the texture of Mackinaw Island fudge the most (which the make on cooled granite stone).  Thanks for sharing!
875884,280,12/16/2011,5,"wow, so good and so easy!  I found that letting the fudge set in the refrigerator overnight made a big difference in the texture, even after it was brought back to room temp.  I used dried cranberries in place of the nuts - orange cranberry fudge!!!  Thanks for a really nice recipe."
83698,280,12/23/2011,5,"This actually came out much better than I anticipated.  I made it with orange extract and walnuts.  I usually spend a ton of time each December baking like mad for my staff, but this year I didn't have time, so I sought out easy recipes.  This was SO quick in the microwave.  After the first batch, I decided I wanted mocha, too, so I made a batch and left out the orange extract.  I added an individual packet of instant coffee to the milk before heating, and it came out perfect.  Thanks for the simple recipe I can use year after year."
222564,280,12/7/2012,5,Just fantastic!
1256030,280,9/14/2013,0,Really really nice. The only thing is that it didn&#039;t settle enough for me to cut pieces. That is probaby because I used a little more milk (400g can).
1800333792,280,11/28/2013,5,"Cadbury Orange Chocolate hello! This recipe is so easy a child could make it and it would turn out. It disappeared as fast as it was made. I used orange extract, 2 tsp., what flavor. I used my microwave for 2 min., mixed it up well with the extract, put it in the pan and let cool, then covered with foil and put it into the frig. 2 hrs. later it was set and ready. My son, husband, daughter-in- law and 3 teenage boys devoured all of it. Thank you very much."
1197624,280,12/31/2013,0,Came out perfect.  Did not need to keep chilled after it had set.  I probably added a bit more zest than listed.
145352,280,10/2/2011,5,Great! Exactly what I had in mind!
140132,280,12/22/2014,5,this is so creamy it practically melts in your mouth.  We loved the hint of orange in this too.  Great addition to our holiday trays. Thank you.
1803605182,280,1/3/2015,5,"Fantastic recipe!  Very easy to follow, even for a rubbish cook like me, and the result was amazing!  I can&#039;t wait to use this recipe again and experiment with flavours!  Can&#039;t recommend it highly enough."
2000789283,280,12/31/2015,5,"Yes!
I made this tasty fudge last night. I love chocolate + orange, so I followed the recipe exactly...including the zest.
I couldn&#039;t believe how fast and easy it was. The texture was smooth, and the fudge was creamy, with a nicely balanced orange flavor. The toasted nuts added crunchy texture. What a win!"
2001334978,280,1/3/2017,5,This looks lovely - I can't wait to try it!
985030,280,10/11/2008,3,"One thing... It might be best not to use wheat flour, as it can be an allergen in dogs. Apart from that it sounds great! Thanks!"
118163,280,9/25/2005,5,"Wow, these were great! I am a hude mushroom fan, and probably a bigger avocado fan so these little guys were jut perfect to me. The thing I added was a little sour cream on the tops of them because I love the combination of hot and cold things. These toasts were creamy, crunchy, juicy, and down right good! They also pair nicely with a glass of merlot. lol. Thanx for posting!"
197023,280,10/29/2005,5,"Chef Kate, these were just SO delicious!  Served these today as a light – but totally sustaining and satisfying – lunch, and I totally recommend this recipe to all who love mushrooms and avocado: a great weekend brunch/lunch dish, or mid-week supper dish.  Quick to prepare, and really scrumptious!  Thank you for sharing!"
58104,280,11/4/2005,5,I cut back on the oil using 1 tablespoon in total for sauting the mushrooms and onions. Didn`t need to top the toasts with any. I found this will serve more then four you can top a whole loaf with the mixture. I enjoy mushrooms and avocados and never thought to put them together. These are great! I used thyme in place of the tarragon. very good and even better knowing I cut more then 1/2 the oil out!
47892,280,11/9/2005,5,"You stole my plans to post this recipe here, Mizz Kate! This is so gooooood!! I love the avocado with all the other ingredients!"
296809,280,7/6/2006,5,"Boy did we ever love this! Except for your bread suggestion, I made this exactly as written. We had it as part of a ZWT appy nite when we tried several things. After adding the avocado & warming it, I stuffed the mix into pita pockets & “dressed” them as directed w/the finishing touches. Was so good that I’ve made it already a 2nd time & will share w/our fishing friends this weekend. Thx for posting."
314579,280,9/19/2006,4,"Kate, this was yummy!  I used small flour tortillas heated under the broiler instead of bread.  I also was out of parmesean, so I used Montrachet goat cheese. Will make this again. (PS. using the new Zaar rating system)"
220582,280,9/30/2006,5,"delish! we modified it a bit for our diet, but used the same basic ingredients. we opted for crisped tortillas, and i cooked everything in a wok to avoid any oil. i didn't have any cheese or herbs, so i just used onion, mushrooms and avacado and drizzled with balsamic. just wonderful."
125388,280,12/28/2006,5,"Very good flavor!  I used 1/2 pound mushrooms and a whole small avocado.  I did not add olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the top, because it didn't seem to need it.  This makes enough for 16-20 baguette slices, not 4."
355920,280,1/21/2007,3,"Very nice, quick, easy meal to prepare. I'm not a 100% sure I would add the tarragon next time. This recipe, as posted, definitely makes more than 4 servings, it's more like 8 rather than 4. All in all, a good meal."
105352,281,2/20/2007,5,This was excellent and itt had lots of flavor. I didn't have any tarragon and substituted basil which worked well. Also I added the olive oil and balsamic vinegar to pan and mixed slightly. Great recipe!
527607,281,2/20/2008,5,"delicious, easy and wonderful.  Great to have with a drink or as a light lunch."
303700,281,9/22/2007,5,"Reviewed for PAC Fall 2007
I LOVE this recipe...I think what really makes it for me is allowing the cukes,onion and potato to marinate in the vinaigrette.
Thanks Adessa!"
28177,282,5/15/2008,5,"Oh what a surprise!  Putting two of my favorite salads together... brilliant!  I love marinated cucumbers (mom did it all the time growing up) & I love creamy potato salad.  This combination of the two is really refreshing.  It was so simple to throw together too.  DH & DS(15) both said it was the addition of cucumber that really made this salad pop.  DD(2) is eating it again for breakfast... hey, when you got a picky toddler you gotta feed them whatever they'll eat!  We will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing Adessa!  Adopted from the PAC Spring 2008 orphanage."
56003,282,7/29/2008,5,"This was scrumptious!  What a lovely marriage of flavors.  I can't pick out any one thing that is special, because everything is great just the way it is.  Thnx for posting, Adessa."
226863,283,4/15/2010,5,"Lovely tasting potato salad!  Loved the taste of the marinade, and the bonus of the creamy taste.  It was a little ""runny"", but I probably didn't drain mine well enough!  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
124249,283,4/16/2007,5,"Served these at my Easter Tea party. I cut the bread into bunny shapes. Everyone liked them. Thanks Redneck Epicurean for a easy and tasty tea sandwich.

Bullwinkle."
59780,284,4/24/2007,5,We served this as part of my Daughter's 10th birthday party formal tea party. These were a big hit with the kids. I dipped the banana slices into gingerale and then assembled the sandwiches and the gingerale prevented the bananas from getting brown. Thanks for sharing!
79997,287,7/24/2007,5,Your legacy lives on in this delightfully simple recipe packed with flavor.  I like the idea of cutting them into shapes.  This is in my keeper box.
592157,287,8/12/2009,5,Simple and delicious. My little one loved them.
573325,287,2/15/2012,5,"Oh yum, what a great combination of flavours! The banana goes great with the honey and bread making this a truly delightful sandwich. I used a local creamy organic honey and organic bananas with local pumpernickel bread for a wholesome treat. Just great and also very pretty to look at! I didnt measure the honey, just spread it on there. :)<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing a keeper with us, Redneck Epicurean!<br/>Made and reviewed for the Honey Tag Game in the Spain/Portugal Forum February 2012."
264017,287,2/24/2008,3,"This was just OK for us. Even with all the listed spices, it seemed to be missing something in the flavor. There was also at least 2 extra cups of sauce that I'll find a use for. Tagged, made and reviewed for the Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Game."
369715,287,9/25/2008,3,This was good but a bit thick for us. I have a similar recipe but we use more milk. It has a good taste and a little bit goes a long way. I made the recipe as written.
383346,288,2/20/2011,5,Very yummy and great texture.  Thanks LadyRatri :)  Made for New Kids on the Block tag game
2000431022,288,8/26/2015,0,Loved this for breakfast. My husband had to ask for seconds. I added salt for taste. Thanks for sharing
2002158749,288,5/20/2018,4,It went great but one or 2 cracked other than that it went well
2000539634,289,10/9/2015,1,"The standing ovation was for an ice cream I made while working at square one. This is not my original recipe, however. I always called it tootsie roll ice cream. I don&#039;t know why Joyce refers to this as hers.  The only difference in her recipe and mine was that I used half cream and half whole milk and bittersweet chocolate not semi-sweet. The standing ovation was not for this recipe."
265954,290,10/9/2015,3,"This is a good starter recipe. I made as directed and thought it was missing something, maybe some diced onion and celery for crunch. With the barbecue sauce, this dish did not need the additional brown sugar, which made this a little too sweet for us. On the plus side, this is a quick and easy recipe to throw together when pressed for time."
